[00:00:00 -> 00:00:07] What do you mean?
[00:00:07 -> 00:00:25] What do you mean how do I play?
[00:00:25 -> 00:00:30] I'm actually.
[00:00:30 -> 00:00:39] So we're doing a quick play.
[00:00:39 -> 00:00:45] What's your rank right now?
[00:00:45 -> 00:01:07] It's going to be tough because I'm think I'm blood one.
[00:01:07 -> 00:01:16] Not hitting any shots.
[00:01:16 -> 00:01:17] Wow.
[00:01:17 -> 00:01:31] Okay.
[00:01:31 -> 00:01:34] When you sold you risk the ball.
[00:01:34 -> 00:01:36] I see a sniper.
[00:02:06 -> 00:02:15] Hmm.
[00:02:36 -> 00:02:38] Oh
[00:03:03 -> 00:03:05] Okay
[00:03:06 -> 00:03:08] Uh
[00:03:16 -> 00:03:20] Got some like if I have discord open I have some issues
[00:03:20 -> 00:03:26] Um, let me close down a discord and see if I have some uh, if my fps comes back
[00:03:28 -> 00:03:30] And we can chat in game
[00:03:30 -> 00:03:32] So
[00:03:36 -> 00:03:43] Well, give me give me a second I can come back then I can come back to discord so don't do anything just wait
[00:03:43 -> 00:03:45] So
[00:03:58 -> 00:04:01] No, it's it's not it doesn't feel smoother, honestly
[00:04:09 -> 00:04:11] Now it's better I think now it's much better
[00:04:13 -> 00:04:15] Okay
[00:04:17 -> 00:04:21] So I probably need to do like a two pc setup
[00:04:25 -> 00:04:27] For streaming
[00:04:43 -> 00:04:45] Is
[00:05:03 -> 00:05:07] It seems like i'm it's working fine now, yeah
[00:05:13 -> 00:05:17] It seems fine, yeah your microphone doesn't sound too good, honestly
[00:05:20 -> 00:05:22] Yep, it does not
[00:05:23 -> 00:05:30] It's kind of muffled or I mean I I understand you really well it's just like the quality is not good
[00:05:35 -> 00:05:37] It's a bit better i'm sure what you did
[00:05:43 -> 00:05:45] So
[00:06:01 -> 00:06:04] I feel kind of I think ready
[00:06:09 -> 00:06:11] Should I test that
[00:06:13 -> 00:06:20] I don't think I tested my sensitivity because I did uh, you know to kind of make my sensitivity in old games the same
[00:06:39 -> 00:06:41] Can you hear me i'm trying to talk with the same volume
[00:06:43 -> 00:06:45] Okay
[00:06:47 -> 00:06:49] Okay
[00:06:49 -> 00:06:52] It's I could also like my volume is
[00:06:53 -> 00:06:58] No, my input volume is maximum on discord. So I can't do much
[00:07:00 -> 00:07:02] Oh, okay, that's not too bad then
[00:07:13 -> 00:07:15] Sensitivity matcher
[00:07:17 -> 00:07:19] It's kind of the same
[00:07:25 -> 00:07:27] Oh much better now
[00:07:36 -> 00:07:40] It's almost the same, uh, it's the positioning
[00:07:43 -> 00:07:45] So
[00:07:54 -> 00:07:56] I understand, okay
[00:08:05 -> 00:08:07] Yeah, okay, are you doing it now
[00:08:07 -> 00:08:14] Okay, so we go now in uh on rent right
[00:08:37 -> 00:08:39] So
[00:08:54 -> 00:08:56] With an arm, right
[00:08:56 -> 00:08:58] I
[00:09:05 -> 00:09:07] Don't know what I picked
[00:09:08 -> 00:09:10] but it's
[00:09:10 -> 00:09:12] I I don't know
[00:09:12 -> 00:09:14] But it looks like the halloween map
[00:09:18 -> 00:09:23] I just wanted something to test my sensitivity matcher. Oof
[00:09:24 -> 00:09:26] I have to decrease it, I think
[00:09:38 -> 00:09:44] Too much yeah, it's it's i'm not going to decrease it too much
[00:09:48 -> 00:09:50] Hello, hello i'm trying to find you
[00:09:53 -> 00:09:55] Be upon you
[00:09:58 -> 00:10:00] Hello, can you hear me? Can you hear my hello?
[00:10:04 -> 00:10:06] You're hiding right
[00:10:23 -> 00:10:25] So
[00:10:27 -> 00:10:32] Okay, then i'm i'm coming don't move i'm coming
[00:10:49 -> 00:10:51] It should be
[00:10:53 -> 00:10:55] Okay
[00:11:23 -> 00:11:25] Oh
[00:11:29 -> 00:11:32] I need I need some snacks. I feel like I need some snacks
[00:11:39 -> 00:11:41] Or start eating that sushi
[00:11:44 -> 00:11:46] This will be smooth sailing
[00:11:53 -> 00:11:55] Okay
[00:11:57 -> 00:11:59] So what do we have okay
[00:12:08 -> 00:12:10] Okay, okay
[00:12:18 -> 00:12:20] So what what can you do now on it
[00:12:23 -> 00:12:25] So
[00:12:46 -> 00:12:48] Almost
[00:12:53 -> 00:12:55] Uh
[00:12:58 -> 00:13:04] You have no supports now, yeah, I mean even if he does the combo on zarya, she's not gonna die
[00:13:23 -> 00:13:25] Oh
[00:13:29 -> 00:13:31] People actually don't care about
[00:13:34 -> 00:13:36] I could not fall back
[00:13:47 -> 00:13:49] People just don't care
[00:13:50 -> 00:13:54] Which is why i'm also not doing any healing
[00:13:59 -> 00:14:01] Ah part of it
[00:14:04 -> 00:14:06] I cannot help you there
[00:14:15 -> 00:14:17] Good job. Good job. You're the healer
[00:14:19 -> 00:14:22] Just compare yourself with others. That's how you improve
[00:14:36 -> 00:14:38] We we don't play as a team or as anything
[00:14:41 -> 00:14:44] Yep one by one by one by one
[00:14:49 -> 00:14:51] Okay
[00:15:02 -> 00:15:08] You got dressed right, okay, we can kill them now here we can
[00:15:08 -> 00:15:10] Yeah
[00:15:18 -> 00:15:22] Yeah, because nobody's flanking and he can just shoot
[00:15:27 -> 00:15:30] Okay, we're we're grouped up
[00:15:39 -> 00:15:43] Score zero to one no problem. I'll go flank
[00:15:47 -> 00:15:49] I'm i'm flanking i'll fix it
[00:15:52 -> 00:15:54] Yep
[00:16:01 -> 00:16:03] That's funny
[00:16:08 -> 00:16:11] Okay, we can win this one
[00:16:38 -> 00:16:40] So
[00:17:01 -> 00:17:03] Yeah, I need to be more careful
[00:17:09 -> 00:17:11] Is not
[00:17:26 -> 00:17:28] Come back if you can
[00:17:31 -> 00:17:33] Come back if you can
[00:17:34 -> 00:17:36] Yeah, I know
[00:17:38 -> 00:17:40] Okay
[00:17:47 -> 00:17:49] Divas dead they have no time
[00:17:49 -> 00:17:51] So
[00:18:06 -> 00:18:08] We should clean up now
[00:18:11 -> 00:18:13] Okay
[00:18:19 -> 00:18:21] So
[00:18:30 -> 00:18:32] Oh splash damage
[00:18:36 -> 00:18:41] A reminder that life is never easy. This is the right
[00:18:43 -> 00:18:45] Our enemies are seizing the objective
[00:18:49 -> 00:18:51] So
[00:18:59 -> 00:19:01] How did she see me I was not hiding at all
[00:19:06 -> 00:19:08] That's impossible hacker hacker hacker
[00:19:10 -> 00:19:12] No, it's funny
[00:19:20 -> 00:19:22] So
[00:19:26 -> 00:19:32] That's why I left because we were alone on the point I went with the tank and the other support
[00:19:36 -> 00:19:38] I I don't know but
[00:19:38 -> 00:19:42] We have to kill them to take the point like I would have died if I stayed there
[00:19:43 -> 00:19:45] That's why I left
[00:19:50 -> 00:19:55] Sometimes it doesn't matter if your team doesn't do the right thing and it's just better to stay with them
[00:19:57 -> 00:19:59] Sometimes
[00:20:19 -> 00:20:21] So
[00:20:42 -> 00:20:44] One boy
[00:20:49 -> 00:20:51] Is
[00:21:08 -> 00:21:10] Emotional damage
[00:21:11 -> 00:21:13] So

[00:21:49 -> 00:21:51] Yeah, I can hear you
[00:22:11 -> 00:22:13] So
[00:22:13 -> 00:22:18] Yeah, because it's not from your team, I know I know it just feels like bad manner
[00:22:41 -> 00:22:43] So
[00:22:51 -> 00:22:53] They want to dance
[00:22:53 -> 00:22:55] Yeah
[00:23:02 -> 00:23:04] Yeah kings from winter
[00:23:08 -> 00:23:13] What do you think that what do you think matt is in masters
[00:23:18 -> 00:23:20] So does his name change based on rank
[00:23:20 -> 00:23:22] I
[00:23:23 -> 00:23:25] Met matt bronze
[00:23:25 -> 00:23:27] So

[00:24:09 -> 00:24:11] Ventures the nick that's a nickname. Oh, okay
[00:24:15 -> 00:24:17] Venture
[00:24:19 -> 00:24:21] Yeah, it makes sense
[00:24:25 -> 00:24:27] Three two
[00:24:47 -> 00:24:49] And we don't
[00:24:50 -> 00:24:53] I think so or ash it was bash ash. Okay
[00:24:55 -> 00:24:57] So
[00:25:03 -> 00:25:05] Is within your grasp
[00:25:25 -> 00:25:27] So
[00:25:52 -> 00:25:54] Does not always lie in victory
[00:25:55 -> 00:25:57] So
[00:26:14 -> 00:26:16] He's low he's low
[00:26:25 -> 00:26:27] So

[00:27:57 -> 00:28:00] Uh doom fist jumped on the point
[00:28:01 -> 00:28:07] Repetition is the path to mastery. I got three olds and we're not using them
[00:28:09 -> 00:28:11] Okay
[00:28:30 -> 00:28:32] Is
[00:28:33 -> 00:28:36] We're hanging on to those goals for their life

[00:46:09 -> 00:46:11] Hello?
[00:46:11 -> 00:46:13] Hello?
[00:46:13 -> 00:46:15] Hello?
[00:46:15 -> 00:46:25] Hello?
[00:46:25 -> 00:46:27] Hello?
[00:46:27 -> 00:46:29] Hello?
[00:46:29 -> 00:46:31] Hello?
[00:46:31 -> 00:46:33] Hello?
[00:46:33 -> 00:46:35] Hello?
[00:46:35 -> 00:46:37] Polish guys
[00:46:37 -> 00:46:39] Polish guys
[00:46:39 -> 00:46:41] Polish guys
[00:46:41 -> 00:46:43] So I spent a month in
[00:46:43 -> 00:47:11] I spent a month in Poland, this September, we're still in 2025, this September, I liked, I think the country is interesting, it has some nice cities, not worse, almost any other city, I didn't like the people a lot because they are way too similar to Romania.
[00:47:12 -> 00:47:31] And I don't like Romanian people, so they seem familiar, yeah. Gdansk is a beautiful city, Krakow also, and a bit in Warsaw. Krakow was also very nice.
[00:47:31 -> 00:47:55] I don't like Romanian people because they're very Eastern European, I don't like the style quite a lot. I'm not sure exactly how to explain, it's just like the style of how they think, what they think they deserve.
[00:47:56 -> 00:48:22] Not necessarily, I mean, they were kind of friendly, but it just feels like the same kind of style. For example, I'm not sure if you drive or not, but driving in Poland felt very bad, it feels like people don't respect other people, and you feel that immediately when you're driving.
[00:48:22 -> 00:48:36] It's just like, oh yeah, I'm driving, this is my street, everybody should be careful, because like, fuck all of you, I'm driving here. So it's just like, I think it's mutual respect.
[00:48:39 -> 00:48:50] Like maybe on the opposite side would be Japan, where you care about other people or you try to respect other people even if you don't know them, even if they're not your friends.
[00:49:22 -> 00:49:32] That's true.
[00:49:52 -> 00:50:13] Another thing was like, it seemed like most Polish people are not very open to new cultures, to outside people.
[00:50:13 -> 00:50:25] So like, this is fine, because you protect your culture, you protect your country, but I'm not Polish, so I would feel the downside of that.
[00:50:26 -> 00:50:28] And Doomfist is gone.
[00:50:31 -> 00:50:32] He's dooming.
[00:50:40 -> 00:50:41] He's doing well.
[00:50:43 -> 00:50:46] Oh, he actually fell.
[00:51:13 -> 00:51:19] Okay.
[00:51:26 -> 00:51:27] Oh, yeah.
[00:51:43 -> 00:51:59] Yeah, it's difficult to follow him.
[00:52:13 -> 00:52:20] Oh, did you die?
[00:52:22 -> 00:52:26] Oh, I thought that someone pushed her or something.
[00:52:36 -> 00:52:39] Go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back.
[00:52:43 -> 00:52:45] Go back, go back.
[00:53:13 -> 00:53:41] Thank you, Anzo.
[00:53:42 -> 00:53:44] We have to kill the others now.
[00:53:47 -> 00:53:49] There's our Doomie.
[00:54:04 -> 00:54:06] He's dead, he's dead, he's dead.
[00:54:11 -> 00:54:12] He's dead.
[00:54:41 -> 00:54:51] We should do a better job of killing people.
[00:54:53 -> 00:54:54] No, me, me, me.
[00:55:11 -> 00:55:31] I think I did not include the Discord sound, I fixed it.
[00:55:31 -> 00:55:32] Can you see something?
[00:55:32 -> 00:55:35] Yeah, fixed it, yeah.
[00:55:35 -> 00:55:36] Okay, cool.
[00:55:36 -> 00:55:39] Discord sound was not in stream, I fixed it now.
[00:55:39 -> 00:55:40] Okay, nice.
[00:55:49 -> 00:55:54] Yay, we have sound from everyone now.
[00:55:54 -> 00:55:56] We, we, we, we, we.
[00:55:56 -> 00:55:57] What am I doing?
[00:56:04 -> 00:56:06] Now the floor is sleeping.
[00:56:09 -> 00:56:15] I cannot heal him there.
[00:56:15 -> 00:56:17] That's fine.
[00:56:17 -> 00:56:18] Nobody can.
[00:56:18 -> 00:56:19] Yeah.
[00:56:29 -> 00:56:32] We have to pull back, we have to pull back, they will push.
[00:56:33 -> 00:56:35] Okay, let's, let's go back.
[00:56:42 -> 00:56:43] Ah, Kiriko.
[00:56:43 -> 00:56:45] And our Doomie is just in...
[00:56:47 -> 00:56:51] Picking up mushrooms, I don't know what's he doing.
[00:56:51 -> 00:56:55] You need the mushrooms for the, for the rooster and arc, so it's...
[00:56:55 -> 00:56:56] Yeah, for scrappy.
[00:56:56 -> 00:56:57] For scrappy.
[00:56:57 -> 00:56:59] To upgrade scrappy.
[00:56:59 -> 00:57:02] I think you need like 12 mushrooms, not easy.
[00:57:02 -> 00:57:04] I have two mushrooms now.
[00:57:13 -> 00:57:14] I hate myself.
[00:57:14 -> 00:57:16] I can't do shit.
[00:57:24 -> 00:57:25] I'm missing everything.
[00:57:27 -> 00:57:28] Yay.
[00:57:29 -> 00:57:30] Yay.
[00:57:59 -> 00:58:00] Finally.
[00:58:04 -> 00:58:05] Okay, I have nano.
[00:58:06 -> 00:58:08] I hope Mei is not dying.
[00:58:15 -> 00:58:17] Oh no, I forgot about Kiriko.
[00:58:19 -> 00:58:21] I shouldn't have pushed that far.
[00:58:23 -> 00:58:24] Oh, he died.
[00:58:24 -> 00:58:25] He died.
[00:58:29 -> 00:58:36] 2v1 rip, yeah, but it's like, I have to remember that 1v1 turns into a 2v1 when Kiriko exists.
[00:58:39 -> 00:58:41] That's, that's my issue.
[00:58:41 -> 00:58:44] And I knew they had the Kiriko, but I forgot.
[00:58:44 -> 00:58:45] 2v1, yeah.
[00:58:45 -> 00:58:47] 2v1 is not great.
[00:58:49 -> 00:58:50] It's...
[00:58:51 -> 00:58:53] A loser's game.
[00:59:03 -> 00:59:04] Oh shit.
[00:59:12 -> 00:59:14] It's only me and you.
[00:59:18 -> 00:59:19] That's great.
[00:59:21 -> 00:59:27] There was no way we survived that, so it's fine.
[00:59:41 -> 00:59:42] Bye.
[00:59:43 -> 00:59:45] Oh shit, where did he go?
[00:59:50 -> 00:59:52] Come take the coin with me.
[01:00:04 -> 01:00:05] Come on, Mei.
[01:00:07 -> 01:00:08] Use your courage.
[01:00:08 -> 01:00:09] Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:10 -> 01:00:13] Mei, Mei, Mei is for courageous.
[01:00:14 -> 01:00:16] She turns into a...
[01:00:17 -> 01:00:20] I mean, she's doing good.
[01:00:25 -> 01:00:31] I was ulting, that's why I was saying that she shouldn't stay in the ice block, just come with me.
[01:00:33 -> 01:00:35] I was going to spawn, I'm sorry.
[01:00:39 -> 01:00:40] It's Kiriko.
[01:00:41 -> 01:00:43] It's Kiriko as a battle Kiriko.
[01:00:43 -> 01:00:45] I mean, she should be.
[01:00:48 -> 01:00:49] True, true, true.
[01:00:49 -> 01:00:50] Easy game.
[01:00:51 -> 01:00:52] Fight easy.
[01:01:14 -> 01:01:19] Lesha, can you check out my stream, see if my mic is fine now?
[01:01:20 -> 01:01:22] Because I did some changes to the sound.
[01:01:24 -> 01:01:26] Or Miko, can you hear me well?
[01:01:26 -> 01:01:27] Yeah, it's working.
[01:01:29 -> 01:01:31] Okay, thank you, it's fine.
[01:01:37 -> 01:01:38] Thanks a lot.
[01:01:44 -> 01:01:46] The only bigula.
[01:01:47 -> 01:01:49] Hello, how are we doing?
[01:01:49 -> 01:01:51] We are doing fine.
[01:01:55 -> 01:01:57] We're just doing some quick playing.
[01:01:58 -> 01:02:03] I'm still hungry, but I know I have some sushi somewhere in the house.
[01:02:05 -> 01:02:06] In the basement.
[01:02:06 -> 01:02:07] In the basement.
[01:02:07 -> 01:02:09] Basement sushi.
[01:02:10 -> 01:02:15] Somewhere, like in the dryer, in the washing machine.
[01:02:15 -> 01:02:18] We don't know, it's somewhere in the house.
[01:02:21 -> 01:02:23] We don't have a basement though.
[01:02:24 -> 01:02:25] Yeah.
[01:02:26 -> 01:02:29] So, maybe it's not in the basement.
[01:02:29 -> 01:02:30] I don't know sushi.
[01:02:39 -> 01:02:40] I don't know.
[01:02:54 -> 01:02:56] Widow sojourn.
[01:03:02 -> 01:03:03] Young Ana.
[01:03:05 -> 01:03:06] Yeah.
[01:03:07 -> 01:03:08] Yeah.
[01:03:21 -> 01:03:22] I like this map.
[01:03:37 -> 01:03:40] Oh my god, Ashe is killing our team.
[01:03:53 -> 01:03:55] I can only nade every now and then.
[01:03:55 -> 01:03:57] I'm trying to keep the tank alive.
[01:03:58 -> 01:04:00] Oh, it's tough.
[01:04:00 -> 01:04:01] It's tough.
[01:04:05 -> 01:04:06] So afraid.
[01:04:07 -> 01:04:11] I mean, they both got killed by Ashe.
[01:04:12 -> 01:04:15] So it was emotional damage.
[01:04:16 -> 01:04:19] Emotional damage.
[01:04:30 -> 01:04:31] Okay.
[01:04:31 -> 01:04:32] Okay.
[01:04:32 -> 01:05:00] Okay.
[01:05:00 -> 01:05:06] Ah, is there free room to join later?
[01:05:06 -> 01:05:07] Yes, it is.
[01:05:09 -> 01:05:11] What's your rank, Vigula?
[01:05:30 -> 01:05:39] Come again to save the day.
[01:05:40 -> 01:05:41] Or not.
[01:05:52 -> 01:05:53] Oh.
[01:06:01 -> 01:06:03] Even the teacher.
[01:06:12 -> 01:06:14] Can your stream hear me?
[01:06:15 -> 01:06:16] I think so.
[01:06:27 -> 01:06:28] Oh my god.
[01:06:30 -> 01:06:31] Oh my god.
[01:06:45 -> 01:06:46] I'm gonna die.
[01:06:46 -> 01:06:47] I'm gonna die.
[01:06:48 -> 01:06:50] I don't have a rank in Overwatch 2.
[01:06:50 -> 01:06:52] But in Overwatch 1, I was flat.
[01:06:55 -> 01:06:57] Yeah, it was very good.
[01:06:58 -> 01:07:00] Diamond 8-9.
[01:07:01 -> 01:07:02] Okay.
[01:07:06 -> 01:07:07] Long break.
[01:07:11 -> 01:07:14] Miko is the filter.
[01:07:15 -> 01:07:16] Yeah.
[01:07:17 -> 01:07:19] Now I'm back into the game again.
[01:07:19 -> 01:07:20] Nice.
[01:07:20 -> 01:07:21] Welcome back to the game.
[01:07:21 -> 01:07:22] Okay.
[01:07:26 -> 01:07:28] Did you play stadium?
[01:07:30 -> 01:07:31] Don't.
[01:07:37 -> 01:07:40] So we're not pushing, we're just letting them take the point.
[01:07:40 -> 01:07:41] Okay, fine.
[01:07:41 -> 01:07:42] Sorry, I didn't get the memo.
[01:07:47 -> 01:07:48] What?
[01:07:49 -> 01:07:50] What are you talking about?
[01:07:51 -> 01:07:52] Our tank.
[01:08:12 -> 01:08:13] Died?
[01:08:13 -> 01:08:14] No.
[01:08:22 -> 01:08:24] I have no more sleep.
[01:08:26 -> 01:08:30] Why would you, like, you cannot sleep Orisa if she's ulting.
[01:08:30 -> 01:08:31] No, the bomb.
[01:08:32 -> 01:08:33] The bomb.
[01:08:38 -> 01:08:41] Yeah, I know I cannot sleep Orisa while she's ulting.
[01:08:42 -> 01:08:43] Thank you.
[01:08:44 -> 01:08:45] You are welcome.
[01:08:48 -> 01:08:49] Pro tip.
[01:08:49 -> 01:08:50] Yeah, pro tip.
[01:08:53 -> 01:08:54] What?
[01:08:54 -> 01:08:55] Oh no, you died.
[01:08:55 -> 01:08:56] Oh no, I died.
[01:08:59 -> 01:09:00] I died too.
[01:09:00 -> 01:09:01] Oh no, you died.
[01:09:03 -> 01:09:05] I died next to a health pack.
[01:09:09 -> 01:09:10] Even worse.
[01:09:11 -> 01:09:13] Dying of thirst next to a...
[01:09:13 -> 01:09:14] Yeah, to a well.
[01:09:14 -> 01:09:15] To a river.
[01:09:15 -> 01:09:17] Yeah, to a well, even worse.
[01:09:20 -> 01:09:23] We're just letting them take the point.
[01:09:23 -> 01:09:24] I'm on point.
[01:09:25 -> 01:09:28] You should not be on the point.
[01:09:28 -> 01:09:29] But when?
[01:09:29 -> 01:09:30] Where?
[01:09:31 -> 01:09:32] Most of the time.
[01:09:32 -> 01:09:34] Where should I be on the point?
[01:09:35 -> 01:09:36] I don't understand.
[01:09:37 -> 01:09:38] It's fine, it's fine.
[01:09:40 -> 01:09:41] Who should take the point?
[01:09:42 -> 01:09:43] You're fine, you're fine.
[01:09:43 -> 01:09:44] You should take the point.
[01:09:45 -> 01:09:47] I'm just so confused.
[01:09:47 -> 01:09:48] What do you want?
[01:09:49 -> 01:09:50] It's not about you.
[01:09:50 -> 01:09:52] I'm really frustrated about the tank.
[01:09:52 -> 01:09:55] Like, I don't know how I can follow the tank over there.
[01:10:04 -> 01:10:05] Okay.
[01:10:05 -> 01:10:06] Yeah, we have no tank.
[01:10:07 -> 01:10:08] We've never had.
[01:10:16 -> 01:10:17] GG no tank.
[01:10:20 -> 01:10:21] Easy.
[01:10:24 -> 01:10:25] Easy.
[01:10:25 -> 01:10:27] Easy as this.
[01:10:42 -> 01:10:44] I'm ready to do anything.
[01:10:44 -> 01:10:45] Nice.
[01:10:45 -> 01:10:46] Okay, join us.
[01:10:50 -> 01:10:52] Are we friends?
[01:10:53 -> 01:10:54] Yeah, we need him.
[01:10:55 -> 01:10:59] I'm going to watch you guys because I need to eat.
[01:10:59 -> 01:11:01] But I'm going to watch your games.
[01:11:01 -> 01:11:02] Okay.
[01:11:05 -> 01:11:06] And I'll join after.
[01:11:06 -> 01:11:07] Okay, okay.
[01:11:08 -> 01:11:09] Ah.
[01:11:20 -> 01:11:25] Are you also on in Discord?
[01:11:34 -> 01:11:35] Hmm.
[01:11:50 -> 01:11:53] I don't remember in Discord what was your...
[01:12:00 -> 01:12:01] I'm in Discord.
[01:12:01 -> 01:12:02] I'm JP.
[01:12:02 -> 01:12:05] Okay, let me find you in Discord so I can invite you.
[01:12:05 -> 01:12:06] JP.
[01:12:06 -> 01:12:07] JP.
[01:12:07 -> 01:12:08] JP!
[01:12:08 -> 01:12:09] Yes.
[01:12:12 -> 01:12:15] I invited you to the voice chat.
[01:12:19 -> 01:12:20] Okay.
[01:12:27 -> 01:12:28] Does it work?
[01:12:34 -> 01:12:36] Don't have access to that voice so I cannot join.
[01:12:36 -> 01:12:37] Fuck.
[01:12:38 -> 01:12:39] Wait.
[01:12:44 -> 01:12:46] Do something.
[01:12:49 -> 01:12:50] Wait a minute.
[01:12:50 -> 01:12:52] Hold up, hold up.
[01:13:13 -> 01:13:15] You should be able...
[01:13:16 -> 01:13:18] Relations.
[01:13:25 -> 01:13:27] You should be able to join.
[01:13:34 -> 01:13:35] Hello.
[01:13:35 -> 01:13:36] Hey.
[01:13:38 -> 01:13:39] How are you?
[01:13:40 -> 01:13:41] I am chill.
[01:13:45 -> 01:13:47] Chill, chill, chill.
[01:13:48 -> 01:13:49] Yes.
[01:13:49 -> 01:13:50] Let's go.
[01:13:52 -> 01:13:54] Oh, he's not missing me.
[01:13:55 -> 01:13:56] He's eating.
[01:13:56 -> 01:13:57] Unicorn is eating.
[01:13:57 -> 01:14:05] And it's going to watch us spectate our beautiful matches.
[01:14:06 -> 01:14:07] Hell yeah.
[01:14:08 -> 01:14:09] Hell yeah.
[01:14:16 -> 01:14:17] How's been...
[01:14:17 -> 01:14:19] How has Christmas been?
[01:14:19 -> 01:14:20] Boring.
[01:14:20 -> 01:14:21] Stay home.
[01:14:21 -> 01:14:22] Boring?
[01:14:22 -> 01:14:23] Yes.
[01:14:23 -> 01:14:24] No.
[01:14:24 -> 01:14:26] Don't celebrate Christmas.
[01:14:27 -> 01:14:28] No.
[01:14:29 -> 01:14:30] Why was it boring?
[01:14:30 -> 01:14:32] Yeah, we don't celebrate Christmas.
[01:14:32 -> 01:14:34] Oh, you don't celebrate Christmas.
[01:14:34 -> 01:14:36] You're celebrating something else?
[01:14:36 -> 01:14:38] No, I just don't.
[01:14:38 -> 01:14:41] Parents left four hours away from me.
[01:14:42 -> 01:14:43] So I don't...
[01:14:43 -> 01:14:44] I stay home.
[01:14:44 -> 01:14:45] I stay home.
[01:14:45 -> 01:14:46] Play video games.
[01:14:46 -> 01:14:47] Drink alcohol.
[01:14:47 -> 01:14:48] Okay.
[01:14:48 -> 01:14:51] So you celebrated Christmas on your own?
[01:14:52 -> 01:14:53] Almost every year.
[01:14:53 -> 01:14:54] It takes too long.
[01:14:55 -> 01:14:57] But four hours is not that far.
[01:14:57 -> 01:14:58] It's pretty far.
[01:14:58 -> 01:14:59] And then four...
[01:14:59 -> 01:15:02] That's eight hours in total.
[01:15:03 -> 01:15:10] Yeah, but it's one day and then you go back the next day or two days after.
[01:15:10 -> 01:15:13] Oh, you don't have a bed to my height.
[01:15:14 -> 01:15:17] Oh, okay, okay.
[01:15:17 -> 01:15:19] Everything down there.
[01:15:19 -> 01:15:26] My pants are very small and I am terrible the size and bed is too small.
[01:15:26 -> 01:15:28] The shower is too small.
[01:15:28 -> 01:15:30] Everything in there is tiny people.
[01:15:31 -> 01:15:34] Tiny people and you are a giant.
[01:15:34 -> 01:15:35] I understand.
[01:15:38 -> 01:15:40] Even the chairs are too tiny.
[01:15:41 -> 01:15:42] Oh my.
[01:15:45 -> 01:15:49] We are almost legally midget height.
[01:15:50 -> 01:15:51] What?
[01:15:51 -> 01:15:55] My parents are almost legally midget height.
[01:15:55 -> 01:15:58] So they're like really, really small.
[01:15:58 -> 01:15:59] Yeah, they're really small people.
[01:15:59 -> 01:16:00] I see.
[01:16:00 -> 01:16:03] All of their furniture is custom made.
[01:16:03 -> 01:16:05] Yeah, pretty much.
[01:16:05 -> 01:16:06] I see.
[01:16:06 -> 01:16:07] Okay.
[01:16:08 -> 01:16:10] But you should have your like...
[01:16:10 -> 01:16:15] Don't you have your bed from when you were...
[01:16:15 -> 01:16:16] No.
[01:16:16 -> 01:16:17] From your childhood?
[01:16:17 -> 01:16:18] No?
[01:16:18 -> 01:16:19] Oh, okay.
[01:16:20 -> 01:16:23] I used after my parents' age, eight to 16.
[01:16:23 -> 01:16:26] And everyone was too tiny.
[01:16:26 -> 01:16:28] I see.
[01:16:31 -> 01:16:36] So what presents did you buy for yourself?
[01:16:36 -> 01:16:37] For myself?
[01:16:37 -> 01:16:38] Yeah.
[01:16:40 -> 01:16:41] A new longboard.
[01:16:41 -> 01:16:42] A new longboard.
[01:16:42 -> 01:16:43] Oh my God.
[01:16:43 -> 01:16:44] So cool.
[01:16:44 -> 01:16:45] What type of longboard?
[01:16:45 -> 01:16:46] Carving.
[01:16:46 -> 01:16:47] Carving, yeah.
[01:16:47 -> 01:16:48] Carving?
[01:16:48 -> 01:16:49] Nice.
[01:16:49 -> 01:16:50] I also have a carving longboard.
[01:16:51 -> 01:16:54] So there's some where I'm waiting to exterminate them.
[01:16:56 -> 01:16:57] Nice.
[01:17:07 -> 01:17:08] Behind us.
[01:17:25 -> 01:17:26] Yay, yo.
[01:17:28 -> 01:17:29] I will...
[01:17:29 -> 01:17:35] After the batch, I will check out what's the name of my longboard and try to find
[01:17:35 -> 01:17:36] it.
[01:17:37 -> 01:17:43] I think if I remember correctly, it's a Spanish brand, but I need to check it out.
[01:17:43 -> 01:17:48] It's also like I modified the tracks anyway.
[01:17:49 -> 01:17:50] Darn.
[01:17:55 -> 01:17:56] Oh no.
[01:17:56 -> 01:17:58] We're dying.
[01:17:58 -> 01:18:05] I'm killing myself.
[01:18:05 -> 01:18:06] I couldn't kill myself.
[01:18:09 -> 01:18:10] Damn.
[01:18:10 -> 01:18:12] But my friend is taking longboards.
[01:18:12 -> 01:18:16] He's creating longboards from scratch and then he's selling them to me.
[01:18:16 -> 01:18:17] Nice.
[01:18:17 -> 01:18:24] So he said you're from Germany?
[01:18:24 -> 01:18:29] No, no, no.
[01:18:29 -> 01:18:36] I'm going to Germany.
[01:18:36 -> 01:18:41] Maybe somewhere.
[01:18:41 -> 01:18:46] You're going to Germany, okay.
[01:18:47 -> 01:18:48] Oh.
[01:18:59 -> 01:19:00] Okay.
[01:19:00 -> 01:19:01] Our tank switch.
[01:19:01 -> 01:19:02] It's okay.
[01:19:02 -> 01:19:03] We're good.
[01:19:03 -> 01:19:04] We're good.
[01:19:04 -> 01:19:05] We're good.
[01:19:05 -> 01:19:06] We're good.
[01:19:06 -> 01:19:07] We're good.
[01:19:07 -> 01:19:08] I will nano.
[01:19:08 -> 01:19:09] Mercy.
[01:19:09 -> 01:19:10] Mercy.
[01:19:20 -> 01:19:21] Oh my God.
[01:19:21 -> 01:19:22] Oh my God.
[01:19:39 -> 01:19:40] Oh my God.
[01:19:40 -> 01:19:41] Oh shit.
[01:19:51 -> 01:19:54] Our team support is killing him.
[01:19:54 -> 01:19:55] Yeah.
[01:19:55 -> 01:19:56] Nice.
[01:19:56 -> 01:19:57] That's a great goal.
[01:20:01 -> 01:20:04] Yeah, she's harassing us, but it's okay.
[01:20:08 -> 01:20:14] She killed our Italian baby.
[01:20:14 -> 01:20:15] Oh.
[01:20:22 -> 01:20:23] Oh shit.
[01:20:23 -> 01:20:25] I died, but it's okay.
[01:20:26 -> 01:20:27] Oh no.
[01:20:27 -> 01:20:28] No.
[01:20:29 -> 01:20:30] Oh no.
[01:20:30 -> 01:20:31] Poor Mercy.
[01:20:35 -> 01:20:36] Yeah, it's annoying.
[01:20:36 -> 01:20:37] It came back.
[01:20:46 -> 01:20:47] Oh.
[01:20:52 -> 01:20:53] Where?
[01:20:56 -> 01:21:02] Nico, when Ramata is in ultimate, I cannot nade him.
[01:21:07 -> 01:21:11] I don't play much nana to know what you can do.
[01:21:11 -> 01:21:12] I can't?
[01:21:12 -> 01:21:17] I don't know where my, where did my nade go then?
[01:21:17 -> 01:21:22] Because I tried to nade him.
[01:21:35 -> 01:21:36] Crazy snipe.
[01:21:36 -> 01:21:37] I don't know what is snipe.
[01:21:40 -> 01:21:42] It was a nade.
[01:21:43 -> 01:21:46] Hello, hello, hello.
[01:21:47 -> 01:21:49] Someone has dropped.
[01:21:49 -> 01:21:50] Yes.
[01:21:51 -> 01:21:52] They're too low now.
[01:21:53 -> 01:21:55] I didn't see that.
[01:22:06 -> 01:22:07] Soldier.
[01:22:07 -> 01:22:08] You can't leave.
[01:22:08 -> 01:22:09] Oh, I get a ride.
[01:22:09 -> 01:22:10] Oh, thank you.
[01:22:10 -> 01:22:13] Yeah, just in the middle of the path, but.
[01:22:23 -> 01:22:24] Next round, I want to go tank.
[01:22:25 -> 01:22:26] Like all the tanks.
[01:22:30 -> 01:22:31] Oh my God!
[01:22:40 -> 01:22:41] Incredible!
[01:22:46 -> 01:22:47] Hello!
[01:22:47 -> 01:22:48] Hello!
[01:22:49 -> 01:22:50] How's it going?
[01:22:50 -> 01:22:51] Hello!
[01:22:51 -> 01:22:52] Athlete.
[01:22:52 -> 01:22:53] Athlete.
[01:22:53 -> 01:22:54] Athlete.
[01:22:54 -> 01:22:55] Athlete.
[01:22:55 -> 01:22:57] You can try and make it.
[01:22:57 -> 01:22:58] Yeah, I'll try and make it.
[01:23:10 -> 01:23:11] I'm going to chase them.
[01:23:16 -> 01:23:17] Oh.
[01:23:19 -> 01:23:21] Let's hope we can get a lot of them.
[01:23:21 -> 01:23:22] Some are behind us.
[01:23:23 -> 01:23:24] Yeah.
[01:23:24 -> 01:23:25] I think they're behind us.
[01:23:25 -> 01:23:27] We need to think of them.
[01:23:27 -> 01:23:29] But it's important indeed.
[01:23:32 -> 01:23:34] It's just distracting them.
[01:23:34 -> 01:23:35] Yeah.
[01:23:40 -> 01:23:41] Watch out for Juno.
[01:23:57 -> 01:23:58] Oh, thank you.
[01:24:01 -> 01:24:02] She's up top.
[01:24:02 -> 01:24:03] Am I?
[01:24:03 -> 01:24:04] Like a hyper.
[01:24:10 -> 01:24:11] He he.
[01:24:18 -> 01:24:20] Marty wants to 1v1.
[01:24:25 -> 01:24:26] Ah!
[01:24:27 -> 01:24:29] I slept him too late.
[01:24:31 -> 01:24:33] I mean, I didn't sleep him.
[01:24:33 -> 01:24:35] I wanted to.
[01:24:35 -> 01:24:36] I pressed.
[01:24:37 -> 01:24:38] Sleep.
[01:24:40 -> 01:24:41] Sleep is fun to use.
[01:24:43 -> 01:24:45] I think sleep is one of the most fun.
[01:24:45 -> 01:24:46] I like that.
[01:24:48 -> 01:24:49] I'm almost fucking out.
[01:24:49 -> 01:24:50] No, no.
[01:24:53 -> 01:24:54] I think I'm going to go out.
[01:24:54 -> 01:24:55] I'm going to use my ulti.
[01:25:10 -> 01:25:11] Oh, I got them.
[01:25:40 -> 01:25:41] Where's the tank?
[01:25:55 -> 01:25:56] We did it.
[01:25:56 -> 01:25:57] Okay, we got this.
[01:25:57 -> 01:25:58] Woo!
[01:25:59 -> 01:26:00] Yay!
[01:26:10 -> 01:26:11] Okay.
[01:26:14 -> 01:26:15] Okay, I'm ready.
[01:26:15 -> 01:26:16] I'll be ready in one minute.
[01:26:27 -> 01:26:29] Bad message from Puma.
[01:26:29 -> 01:26:30] Fuck you, Puma.
[01:26:37 -> 01:26:38] Oops, sorry.
[01:26:38 -> 01:26:39] There you are.
[01:26:41 -> 01:26:43] You want to play Doomfist.
[01:26:53 -> 01:26:54] How's your Christmas going?
[01:26:56 -> 01:26:57] It's going really well.
[01:26:57 -> 01:26:58] Thank you.
[01:27:00 -> 01:27:05] I spent the first day of Christmas with the extended family.
[01:27:05 -> 01:27:07] And then...
[01:27:08 -> 01:27:10] Oh, I think, yeah.
[01:27:10 -> 01:27:12] And then the second day,
[01:27:14 -> 01:27:18] I just stayed at home under the blanket because I caught a cold.
[01:27:18 -> 01:27:22] And I've been feeling quite steamy.
[01:27:22 -> 01:27:26] And last night I had like a massive migraine.
[01:27:26 -> 01:27:29] So hopefully today I'm not going to feel that bad.
[01:27:30 -> 01:27:31] But yeah.
[01:27:31 -> 01:27:32] Oh, yeah.
[01:27:33 -> 01:27:35] Good and bad at the same time.
[01:27:35 -> 01:27:36] At the same time.
[01:27:36 -> 01:27:37] Balanced.
[01:27:37 -> 01:27:38] Just like Overwatch.
[01:27:47 -> 01:27:48] I'm slowly getting sick.
[01:27:51 -> 01:27:52] Oh, no.
[01:27:53 -> 01:27:54] Yeah.
[01:27:54 -> 01:27:58] My vocals start hurting every time I talk and breathe and drinking water.
[01:28:00 -> 01:28:02] You need to drink water maybe.
[01:28:02 -> 01:28:07] Maybe take some, I don't know, paracetamol.
[01:28:11 -> 01:28:12] Yeah.
[01:28:13 -> 01:28:15] I'm beginning to go be...
[01:28:16 -> 01:28:17] Ah, missed.
[01:28:24 -> 01:28:25] I'm back.
[01:28:27 -> 01:28:29] I'm trying to play Doomfist.
[01:28:29 -> 01:28:30] I still love Doomfist.
[01:28:31 -> 01:28:32] Can you guys hear me?
[01:28:35 -> 01:28:36] Hello, hello.
[01:28:38 -> 01:28:39] Oh.
[01:28:39 -> 01:28:41] You should be able to hear me now, right?
[01:28:41 -> 01:28:42] Welcome back.
[01:28:42 -> 01:28:44] Yeah, we just started it.
[01:28:44 -> 01:28:45] So, sorry.
[01:28:45 -> 01:28:46] That's fine.
[01:28:49 -> 01:28:52] Yeah, if you told us...
[01:28:52 -> 01:28:59] A little bit earlier we could...
[01:29:01 -> 01:29:04] We could just do something.
[01:29:05 -> 01:29:06] That's okay.
[01:29:07 -> 01:29:08] Yay.
[01:29:08 -> 01:29:10] I'm by a unicorn.
[01:29:11 -> 01:29:12] Jenny out of me.
[01:29:14 -> 01:29:16] I'm too far from my mic, I assume.
[01:29:17 -> 01:29:18] Yeah.
[01:29:18 -> 01:29:20] We can hear you better now.
[01:29:20 -> 01:29:21] Yeah.
[01:29:23 -> 01:29:26] Sometimes I didn't beg and I was forgetting.
[01:29:31 -> 01:29:32] Can you move?
[01:29:32 -> 01:29:34] I mean, you fucked up my...
[01:29:34 -> 01:29:35] Please.
[01:29:35 -> 01:29:36] Thank you.
[01:29:39 -> 01:29:40] Okay.
[01:29:43 -> 01:29:44] Oh.
[01:29:46 -> 01:29:47] Oh.
[01:29:48 -> 01:29:50] Come on, come on, come on.
[01:29:51 -> 01:29:52] Come on, come on.
[01:29:53 -> 01:29:55] Oh, what did we just see?
[01:30:14 -> 01:30:15] Oh shit, not them.
[01:30:18 -> 01:30:19] Bro.
[01:30:19 -> 01:30:21] Come on, come on, come on.
[01:30:25 -> 01:30:27] Get out of my face.
[01:30:31 -> 01:30:32] We're evil.
[01:30:36 -> 01:30:40] Diana, I was actually trying to be sneaky and I missed my sleep.
[01:30:41 -> 01:30:46] Yeah, he wants my little grandma ass.
[01:30:50 -> 01:30:51] Oh shit.
[01:30:53 -> 01:30:54] Oh shit.
[01:31:05 -> 01:31:06] I almost fell off.
[01:31:14 -> 01:31:16] Oh, I missed that sleep.
[01:31:16 -> 01:31:17] Okay.
[01:31:19 -> 01:31:20] Okay.
[01:31:24 -> 01:31:26] Spilled my smash.
[01:31:33 -> 01:31:34] I'm on my way.
[01:31:49 -> 01:31:50] Oh shit.
[01:31:55 -> 01:31:56] Are you okay?
[01:31:57 -> 01:31:59] Just bunking out of it.
[01:32:02 -> 01:32:03] That's evil.
[01:32:07 -> 01:32:08] I'm on my way.
[01:32:20 -> 01:32:22] Why'd you do that?
[01:32:36 -> 01:32:39] Trimble before me or whatever he's saying.
[01:32:41 -> 01:32:43] I think they're coming.
[01:32:43 -> 01:32:44] Oh.
[01:33:06 -> 01:33:08] Hello, Cat C.
[01:33:10 -> 01:33:11] How are you?
[01:33:14 -> 01:33:18] I'm waiting for my team to finish and we'll join after that.
[01:33:18 -> 01:33:19] I'll join them.
[01:33:34 -> 01:33:36] Your Pharah is AFK.
[01:33:36 -> 01:33:37] Oh is? Oh.
[01:33:40 -> 01:33:41] Oh well.
[01:33:43 -> 01:33:44] I want dinner.
[01:33:50 -> 01:33:51] Oh.
[01:33:51 -> 01:33:52] Don't mind me.
[01:33:53 -> 01:33:54] Thank you.
[01:34:11 -> 01:34:12] Oh, I'm going.
[01:34:13 -> 01:34:15] There's a cat to be flanking.
[01:34:31 -> 01:34:32] Where's my DPS?
[01:34:43 -> 01:34:51] Okay, I'm leaving.
[01:35:06 -> 01:35:07] Good sleep.
[01:35:07 -> 01:35:08] Good sleep.
[01:35:14 -> 01:35:15] Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:35:15 -> 01:35:16] I was reloading.
[01:35:17 -> 01:35:18] Nice sleep.
[01:35:18 -> 01:35:25] I just think playing Pharah is kind of annoying because you need anything.
[01:35:28 -> 01:35:30] You're not using your scope a lot.
[01:35:31 -> 01:35:32] Yeah.
[01:35:43 -> 01:36:08] Can you touch?
[01:36:08 -> 01:36:09] Can you touch?
[01:36:23 -> 01:36:25] I'm to play Reinhardt instead then.
[01:36:27 -> 01:36:28] Okay, go Reinhardt.
[01:36:38 -> 01:36:40] Strongest woman in the world.
[01:36:41 -> 01:36:44] In Rata, game plays you.
[01:37:03 -> 01:37:05] My last round spectating.
[01:37:06 -> 01:37:07] Yeah.
[01:37:09 -> 01:37:10] And then I need to be.
[01:37:21 -> 01:37:22] I did a stupid thing.
[01:37:38 -> 01:37:39] Okay.
[01:38:08 -> 01:38:20] Hey Passos, thanks for joining the unicorn blessing.
[01:38:20 -> 01:38:22] You're part of the group now.
[01:38:33 -> 01:38:34] Oh, someone over there.
[01:38:34 -> 01:38:35] Yeah.
[01:38:36 -> 01:38:37] Got you.
[01:38:55 -> 01:38:56] Thanks a lot, Passos.
[01:39:05 -> 01:39:06] Thank you.
[01:39:13 -> 01:39:14] I didn't die.
[01:39:17 -> 01:39:18] Where's my heal?
[01:39:19 -> 01:39:20] I was in the back.
[01:39:20 -> 01:39:21] Sorry.
[01:39:21 -> 01:39:22] No, it's okay.
[01:39:22 -> 01:39:24] Playing respawns me later.
[01:39:26 -> 01:39:27] It's okay.
[01:39:27 -> 01:39:28] I also have, I didn't die.
[01:39:35 -> 01:39:46] Good job.
[01:39:46 -> 01:39:48] That was a very good match.
[01:40:02 -> 01:40:03] Let me get to kill.
[01:40:06 -> 01:40:07] Yeah, it's this clip.
[01:40:10 -> 01:40:11] Okay, okay.
[01:40:11 -> 01:40:12] I'm ready.
[01:40:15 -> 01:40:17] The sushi was actually very good.
[01:40:19 -> 01:40:21] Yeah, I need to go feed.
[01:40:21 -> 01:40:22] Go, go.
[01:40:31 -> 01:40:33] Yeah, I do stream.
[01:40:33 -> 01:40:34] I started recently.
[01:40:35 -> 01:40:36] Okay.
[01:40:38 -> 01:40:44] I'm doing Overwatch, Arc Raiders, and sometimes the finals.
[01:40:44 -> 01:40:46] I'm really bad at the finals.
[01:40:46 -> 01:40:49] And I'm, I really enjoy doing Arc Raiders.
[01:40:49 -> 01:40:55] Yesterday I did a stream with a kind of a challenge like PvP challenge with an Excel sheet and so on.
[01:40:55 -> 01:40:59] It's like properly with a set of rules, properly documented.
[01:40:59 -> 01:41:00] It was really fun.
[01:41:00 -> 01:41:02] I'm going to do that again soon.
[01:41:03 -> 01:41:04] Well, yeah.
[01:41:06 -> 01:41:12] The basic idea was that I started, I'm not sure if you're familiar with the game Arc Raiders, but you.
[01:41:12 -> 01:41:16] It's like Warsome, but just robots flying around.
[01:41:18 -> 01:41:26] You have a, you have a stash and you have some items that you have, always have, like have them in your, at your base.
[01:41:26 -> 01:41:28] If you die, you lose all of that.
[01:41:28 -> 01:41:29] Yeah.
[01:41:29 -> 01:41:33] If you manage to get out, what you get out, you can add to your stash.
[01:41:33 -> 01:41:38] And I had this rule of starting with a free loadout.
[01:41:38 -> 01:41:43] A free loadout is like, it's just like a basic set of items you can take with you.
[01:41:43 -> 01:41:46] And they're not that great.
[01:41:47 -> 01:41:51] And I could, I could upgrade those once I came back.
[01:41:51 -> 01:41:53] So like I could use.
[01:41:53 -> 01:41:54] Hey Sasha.
[01:41:54 -> 01:42:05] I will do it again.
[01:42:05 -> 01:42:08] If you follow, you will, you will see that.
[01:42:10 -> 01:42:14] And you'll kind of understand what, what's it about.
[01:42:14 -> 01:42:17] He played the finals only because of Arc Raiders.
[01:42:19 -> 01:42:23] So Possos is saying that he played the finals because of Arc Raiders.
[01:42:23 -> 01:42:26] I actually played the finals before Arc Raiders.
[01:42:26 -> 01:42:31] And I really liked what the developer did with the game.
[01:42:31 -> 01:42:34] Cause it was really unique.
[01:42:34 -> 01:42:37] They really created like a really unique game.
[01:42:37 -> 01:42:38] It is PVP.
[01:42:38 -> 01:42:40] It is team-based, but it's very different.
[01:42:42 -> 01:42:46] And that's how I kind of gained respect for them.
[01:42:46 -> 01:42:49] And then I tried the Arc and I was blown away.
[01:42:52 -> 01:42:54] Bigelow, thanks for joining the unicorn blessing.
[01:42:54 -> 01:42:55] Thanks a lot.
[01:42:55 -> 01:42:56] Thanks a lot.
[01:42:56 -> 01:43:00] You know, you know what the group of unicorns is called?
[01:43:00 -> 01:43:01] No.
[01:43:01 -> 01:43:02] The unicorn blessing.
[01:43:02 -> 01:43:05] I had to feed the doggy as well.
[01:43:05 -> 01:43:06] That's fine.
[01:43:06 -> 01:43:08] You play PUE?
[01:43:08 -> 01:43:11] I'm seeing a steam PUE Path of Exile.
[01:43:11 -> 01:43:15] I play everything, I guess.
[01:43:15 -> 01:43:18] I used to play Path of Exile.
[01:43:18 -> 01:43:19] Yeah.
[01:43:19 -> 01:43:21] I'm not doing that much now.
[01:43:21 -> 01:43:22] I played Apex a lot.
[01:43:22 -> 01:43:23] Yeah.
[01:43:23 -> 01:43:25] I kind of stopped playing Apex.
[01:43:25 -> 01:43:30] I want to get back into it, but I just never got the motivation.
[01:43:30 -> 01:43:31] I understand.
[01:43:31 -> 01:43:34] It was really good for a while.
[01:43:34 -> 01:43:37] I don't feel like playing it now.
[01:43:37 -> 01:43:38] I don't know.
[01:43:38 -> 01:43:39] I don't know.
[01:43:39 -> 01:43:40] I don't know.
[01:43:40 -> 01:43:41] I don't know.
[01:43:41 -> 01:43:42] I don't know.
[01:43:42 -> 01:43:43] I don't know.
[01:43:43 -> 01:43:44] I don't know.
[01:43:44 -> 01:43:45] I don't know.
[01:43:45 -> 01:43:46] I don't know.
[01:43:46 -> 01:43:47] I don't know.
[01:43:47 -> 01:43:48] It was really good for a while.
[01:43:48 -> 01:43:51] I don't feel like playing it now.
[01:43:51 -> 01:43:53] Especially, you kind of have to choose.
[01:43:53 -> 01:43:55] What are you going to do with your time?
[01:43:55 -> 01:43:58] And most of the times, I honestly choose Arc Raiders.
[01:43:58 -> 01:43:59] Yeah.
[01:44:02 -> 01:44:03] So, Paso is the same.
[01:44:03 -> 01:44:06] He heard something about food.
[01:44:06 -> 01:44:08] Sasha was talking to...
[01:44:08 -> 01:44:09] Yeah.
[01:44:10 -> 01:44:11] Yeah.
[01:44:11 -> 01:44:12] The dog.
[01:44:12 -> 01:44:14] If you need a dog.
[01:44:14 -> 01:44:15] It's not the...
[01:44:15 -> 01:44:16] Sasha the human.
[01:44:16 -> 01:44:17] I know what you've been playing.
[01:44:17 -> 01:44:18] You've been playing Sugara Clicker.
[01:44:18 -> 01:44:19] Man, you're weird for that.
[01:44:19 -> 01:44:20] I know what that is.
[01:44:20 -> 01:44:21] That's weird you have that.
[01:44:21 -> 01:44:22] I thought I made that private, honestly.
[01:44:22 -> 01:44:23] Privately.
[01:44:23 -> 01:44:24] Damn.
[01:44:24 -> 01:44:25] I thought the game was not a thing, but it's still a thing.
[01:44:25 -> 01:44:26] I used to play it.
[01:44:26 -> 01:44:27] Arc Raiders or what?
[01:44:27 -> 01:44:28] I don't know.
[01:44:28 -> 01:44:29] I don't know.
[01:44:29 -> 01:44:30] I don't know.
[01:44:30 -> 01:44:31] I don't know.
[01:44:31 -> 01:44:32] I don't know.
[01:44:32 -> 01:44:33] I don't know.
[01:44:33 -> 01:44:34] I don't know.
[01:44:34 -> 01:44:35] I don't know.
[01:44:35 -> 01:44:36] I don't know.
[01:44:36 -> 01:44:37] I don't know.
[01:44:37 -> 01:44:38] I don't know.
[01:44:38 -> 01:44:39] I don't know.
[01:45:09 -> 01:45:14] The thing with Mad Fun 2.
[01:45:14 -> 01:45:17] Fractured, but whole, right?
[01:45:17 -> 01:45:18] Yes.
[01:45:18 -> 01:45:21] Time for pinky stuff!
[01:45:21 -> 01:45:23] Oh, you played Trin.
[01:45:23 -> 01:45:25] T-r-i-n-e.
[01:45:25 -> 01:45:27] I have Tosiri.
[01:45:27 -> 01:45:28] Trine.
[01:45:28 -> 01:45:29] Which one?
[01:45:29 -> 01:45:30] Yeah, Trine.
[01:45:30 -> 01:45:31] Yeah.
[01:45:31 -> 01:45:32] Yeah?
[01:45:32 -> 01:45:33] I also played Trine.
[01:45:33 -> 01:45:35] This is an old game.
[01:45:35 -> 01:45:38] It's very old.
[01:45:38 -> 01:45:46] What the fuck is happening with my overwatch? Can you see this?
[01:45:46 -> 01:45:50] I don't know, it just started.
[01:45:50 -> 01:45:56] I wanna play the alto. No, the middle.
[01:45:56 -> 01:46:02] Esperanza. Welcome to Esperanza.
[01:46:02 -> 01:46:05] Welcome to Esperanza. Go back to Esperanza.
[01:46:05 -> 01:46:08] You got the middle one. You don't want to play bush, bush.
[01:46:08 -> 01:46:11] Yay, the winner.
[01:46:11 -> 01:46:15] Welcome to Esperanza.
[01:46:15 -> 01:46:18] Time to play Doomfist because I want to be aggressive.
[01:46:18 -> 01:46:22] I want to be a one trick Doomfist.
[01:46:27 -> 01:46:32] Click, click, click. I hate this skin because it's fake.
[01:46:32 -> 01:46:35] Doomfist left. Nice.
[01:46:35 -> 01:46:38] That's so good. Good one, Miko.
[01:46:42 -> 01:46:45] Miko just played the don't shoot.
[01:46:51 -> 01:46:54] It's one of my favorites.
[01:46:54 -> 01:47:03] I need to add some overwatch soundbites as well.
[01:47:04 -> 01:47:07] Look at my lips. This doesn't look good to the skin.
[01:47:07 -> 01:47:10] I have purple lips and that is huge.
[01:47:15 -> 01:47:18] Yeah.
[01:47:20 -> 01:47:23] She's on the other side.
[01:47:24 -> 01:47:27] I'm running. Look at my legs.
[01:47:27 -> 01:47:30] I'm running.
[01:47:30 -> 01:47:36] Have you seen quite an old clip when someone made them to run like a normal person?
[01:47:36 -> 01:47:39] Oh, lol.
[01:47:39 -> 01:47:42] He's in the way.
[01:47:59 -> 01:48:02] I'll wait.
[01:48:02 -> 01:48:13] Let me know if I play too aggressive and I will play non-aggressive.
[01:48:13 -> 01:48:16] You'll know it when you die.
[01:48:16 -> 01:48:19] If you die too much, you will know.
[01:48:32 -> 01:48:43] I think they need to fall back a little bit because they're pushing.
[01:48:46 -> 01:48:49] D.Va really wanted me here.
[01:48:50 -> 01:48:53] We got the mercy. That's what I wanted to do.
[01:48:53 -> 01:48:56] Yeah. She also got the mercy.
[01:48:59 -> 01:49:01] That's what she wanted to do.
[01:49:02 -> 01:49:05] You're way too far now. Come back if you can.
[01:49:05 -> 01:49:06] Me?
[01:49:06 -> 01:49:08] No, not you.
[01:49:08 -> 01:49:11] I'm running.
[01:49:11 -> 01:49:14] I don't want to be there.
[01:49:14 -> 01:49:17] Just don't know my aim.
[01:49:17 -> 01:49:20] I don't know what way I want to go.
[01:49:32 -> 01:49:35] I got the killer.
[01:49:38 -> 01:49:41] I'm doing something wrong.
[01:49:44 -> 01:49:47] Oh, she soloed all of me.
[01:49:47 -> 01:49:48] Wow.
[01:49:48 -> 01:49:51] Waste.
[01:49:51 -> 01:49:54] That was not worth it at all.
[01:49:55 -> 01:49:58] That was not worth it at all.
[01:50:20 -> 01:50:23] Come on, guys. We have to kill Vendetta again.
[01:50:23 -> 01:50:26] We have to move up.
[01:50:38 -> 01:50:41] One more way.
[01:50:53 -> 01:50:56] Oh, please.
[01:51:00 -> 01:51:03] I missed that.
[01:51:17 -> 01:51:20] Oh, my God, he's one.
[01:51:23 -> 01:51:26] We need to kill the Mercy.
[01:51:26 -> 01:51:29] The Mercy is doing really bad thanks to us.
[01:51:29 -> 01:51:32] I'm having a hard time punishing her.
[01:51:39 -> 01:51:42] Yeah, yes. Of course.
[01:51:49 -> 01:51:52] Why did I die?
[01:51:53 -> 01:51:56] Why did I die?
[01:52:17 -> 01:52:22] I'm sorry, but one of our DPS is not doing great.
[01:52:23 -> 01:52:26] The Echo.
[01:52:26 -> 01:52:28] One of the flyers.
[01:52:28 -> 01:52:31] Yeah, the one that is changing nonstop.
[01:52:33 -> 01:52:36] I didn't do well either.
[01:52:36 -> 01:52:39] I'm ashamed.
[01:52:40 -> 01:52:43] We're fine.
[01:52:46 -> 01:52:49] Crack.
[01:52:49 -> 01:52:52] My Jackson.
[01:52:55 -> 01:52:58] He's not even trying to aim anymore.
[01:53:05 -> 01:53:08] Give me a fun map.
[01:53:08 -> 01:53:11] Give me the old, old school map.
[01:53:11 -> 01:53:14] The classic old map you don't see nowadays.
[01:53:14 -> 01:53:17] How did they remove the Overwatch 1 maps?
[01:53:17 -> 01:53:20] Thank God.
[01:53:27 -> 01:53:30] I remember I was learning about the word.
[01:53:30 -> 01:53:33] Oh, OK.
[01:53:33 -> 01:53:38] For me, I didn't understand how to make some sentences
[01:53:38 -> 01:53:41] with articles like.
[01:53:41 -> 01:53:44] Or for me, I could say.
[01:53:47 -> 01:53:50] Or.
[01:53:52 -> 01:53:55] Oh, you mean.
[01:53:55 -> 01:53:56] No, I get it.
[01:53:56 -> 01:53:59] I get it.
[01:54:00 -> 01:54:02] It has way too many rules.
[01:54:02 -> 01:54:05] It's not a practical language.
[01:54:09 -> 01:54:12] Unfortunately, is actually.
[01:54:12 -> 01:54:15] Thank you.
[01:54:15 -> 01:54:18] Feminine, the feminine for cleaning.
[01:54:18 -> 01:54:21] Is.
[01:54:21 -> 01:54:24] Is.
[01:54:26 -> 01:54:29] It's like if it's articulated.
[01:54:29 -> 01:54:32] It's.
[01:54:32 -> 01:54:33] Yeah.
[01:54:33 -> 01:54:36] So it's.
[01:54:38 -> 01:54:41] Sounds very good.
[01:54:42 -> 01:54:45] This is Romanian.
[01:54:45 -> 01:54:46] This is Romanian.
[01:54:46 -> 01:54:49] We're both Romanian.
[01:55:01 -> 01:55:04] My shield is almost down again.
[01:55:04 -> 01:55:07] My shield is down.
[01:55:07 -> 01:55:10] Take some damage, we can heal you a little bit.
[01:55:12 -> 01:55:15] Yes, I feel this up again.
[01:55:15 -> 01:55:18] I need help.
[01:55:24 -> 01:55:27] There's a prey up top.
[01:55:31 -> 01:55:34] We're with the same DPS from earlier.
[01:55:36 -> 01:55:39] Had some issues.
[01:55:42 -> 01:55:45] I feel this bounce through.
[01:55:51 -> 01:55:54] Pull back, pull back.
[01:55:54 -> 01:55:57] We lost one.
[01:55:57 -> 01:56:00] One support.
[01:56:00 -> 01:56:03] And I could be.
[01:56:03 -> 01:56:06] I'm.
[01:56:29 -> 01:56:30] You can be aggressive.
[01:56:30 -> 01:56:31] I have the ult.
[01:56:31 -> 01:56:34] If you jump in them, I can help.
[01:56:37 -> 01:56:40] Go back, pull back.
[01:56:43 -> 01:56:44] Nice, nice, nice.
[01:56:44 -> 01:56:47] Good job, good job.
[01:57:00 -> 01:57:03] I'm about to have ultimate.
[01:57:06 -> 01:57:09] Far in.
[01:57:10 -> 01:57:13] And shield is down.
[01:57:26 -> 01:57:29] Oh my goodness.
[01:57:29 -> 01:57:32] Oh my goodness.
[01:57:46 -> 01:57:49] Got the healer.
[01:57:59 -> 01:58:02] Nice.
[01:58:24 -> 01:58:27] No.
[01:58:29 -> 01:58:30] Thank you.
[01:58:31 -> 01:58:34] I'm afraid of the Junkrat.
[01:58:34 -> 01:58:37] Okay, fixed it.
[01:58:52 -> 01:58:56] I got ult, so it can be aggro.
[01:58:59 -> 01:59:02] Maybe not that aggro.
[01:59:02 -> 01:59:05] I cannot fly to you.
[01:59:05 -> 01:59:08] So quickly.
[01:59:08 -> 01:59:11] I thought you want to go in.
[01:59:11 -> 01:59:14] I want to go in, but I cannot fly as fast as you do.
[01:59:14 -> 01:59:17] I thought you want to go in.
[01:59:17 -> 01:59:20] I want to go in, but I cannot fly as fast as you do.
[01:59:20 -> 01:59:23] It's going to be winning.
[01:59:44 -> 01:59:47] Oh my goodness.
[02:00:01 -> 02:00:04] Good job.
[02:00:04 -> 02:00:07] Good job.
[02:00:14 -> 02:00:15] This is going to hurt.
[02:00:15 -> 02:00:18] Yeah, I felt it.
[02:00:29 -> 02:00:32] My Arctic is not changing.
[02:00:32 -> 02:00:35] Something like replacing those machines.
[02:00:40 -> 02:00:41] What's it called?
[02:00:41 -> 02:00:43] I don't know her abilities.
[02:00:43 -> 02:00:44] I forgot.
[02:00:44 -> 02:00:47] Those small sentries that shoot laser beams.
[02:00:48 -> 02:00:52] Symmetra's abilities, they changed her so many times that
[02:00:52 -> 02:00:56] if you didn't play her recently, it doesn't matter.
[02:00:57 -> 02:01:00] But she does have those sentry turrets.
[02:01:02 -> 02:01:06] And they gave her the shield back, which was actually good.
[02:01:09 -> 02:01:11] They're fucking dead.
[02:01:11 -> 02:01:13] We can kill all of them now.
[02:01:13 -> 02:01:16] They made a mistake.
[02:01:16 -> 02:01:19] I made a mistake.
[02:01:32 -> 02:01:33] Oh my God.
[02:01:33 -> 02:01:36] I say be careful, then I die.
[02:01:36 -> 02:01:38] Go back, go back, go back.
[02:01:38 -> 02:01:41] Let them take the point.
[02:01:41 -> 02:01:44] But I don't know if he went past.
[02:01:46 -> 02:01:49] He knew it was me.
[02:02:01 -> 02:02:02] Uh-oh.
[02:02:02 -> 02:02:05] I better go.
[02:02:11 -> 02:02:14] May, you're in the way.
[02:02:14 -> 02:02:15] Fuck.
[02:02:15 -> 02:02:16] He was behind me.
[02:02:16 -> 02:02:20] I was trying to make stupid ice cream.
[02:02:21 -> 02:02:22] That's annoying.
[02:02:22 -> 02:02:24] Oh, Kirikou.
[02:02:24 -> 02:02:27] May got me killed.
[02:02:28 -> 02:02:31] That's a hitbox, I think.
[02:02:31 -> 02:02:34] That's a hitbox, I think.
[02:03:01 -> 02:03:04] That's a hitbox, I think.
[02:03:04 -> 02:03:07] That's a hitbox, I think.
[02:03:29 -> 02:03:32] Stay safe, stay safe for a bit.
[02:03:32 -> 02:03:35] I'm trying.
[02:03:47 -> 02:03:50] I tried, I tried.
[02:03:52 -> 02:03:54] Oh, steep is.
[02:03:54 -> 02:03:57] Bam.
[02:03:57 -> 02:03:58] RIP.
[02:03:58 -> 02:04:01] Totally rip.
[02:04:01 -> 02:04:04] Don't give up the same DPS again.
[02:04:04 -> 02:04:07] Not the same people.
[02:04:07 -> 02:04:10] Don't give up the same DPS again.
[02:04:10 -> 02:04:13] Not the same people.
[02:04:33 -> 02:04:36] Oh, he's watching.
[02:04:36 -> 02:04:39] I'm playing DPS.
[02:04:40 -> 02:04:42] I wanna play some tank.
[02:04:42 -> 02:04:45] Me too.
[02:04:45 -> 02:04:48] Let's play some tank.
[02:04:48 -> 02:04:50] Let's play some tank.
[02:04:50 -> 02:04:53] We can go 6v6 and we both play tank.
[02:04:53 -> 02:04:56] But it feels like a different...
[02:04:56 -> 02:04:59] Actually, me neither.
[02:04:59 -> 02:05:03] I'm not sure if I'm going to play Orisa, maybe Ramatra.
[02:05:03 -> 02:05:06] I wanna play Ramatra.
[02:05:06 -> 02:05:09] But if I need to switch, I will go Orisa.
[02:05:09 -> 02:05:12] But if I need to switch, I will go Orisa.
[02:05:12 -> 02:05:15] How much RAM do you have, Ramatra?
[02:05:15 -> 02:05:18] I don't actually know.
[02:05:18 -> 02:05:21] I don't actually know.
[02:05:21 -> 02:05:24] How do I check?
[02:05:24 -> 02:05:27] You go to your Twitch profile and you have it there.
[02:05:27 -> 02:05:30] You go to your Twitch profile and you have it there.
[02:05:30 -> 02:05:33] You're right! You're so right!
[02:05:41 -> 02:05:44] I wish I had more RAMs.
[02:05:44 -> 02:05:47] Need more RAM.
[02:05:47 -> 02:05:50] I have 128 GB of RAM.
[02:05:50 -> 02:05:53] I have 128 GB of RAM.
[02:05:53 -> 02:05:56] I have 64 RAMs.
[02:05:56 -> 02:05:59] I have 32 GB of DDR4.
[02:05:59 -> 02:06:02] I have DDR5.
[02:06:02 -> 02:06:05] I have 128.
[02:06:15 -> 02:06:18] I need to get more RAM.
[02:06:18 -> 02:06:21] 32?
[02:06:21 -> 02:06:24] RAM is pretty expensive now.
[02:06:24 -> 02:06:27] Why do you need more?
[02:06:27 -> 02:06:30] Just to be rich.
[02:06:30 -> 02:06:33] Like you guys.
[02:06:33 -> 02:06:36] I think you're poor if you buy more.
[02:06:36 -> 02:06:39] Yeah, you're right.
[02:06:39 -> 02:06:42] I think I don't need more RAM, honestly.
[02:06:42 -> 02:06:45] I'll gladly sell you my server.
[02:06:45 -> 02:06:48] I need a new server.
[02:06:51 -> 02:06:54] With 125 TB.
[02:06:54 -> 02:06:57] Of storage?
[02:06:57 -> 02:07:00] Yeah, server storage.
[02:07:00 -> 02:07:03] I heard you need RAM, so I'm going to give you storage.
[02:07:03 -> 02:07:06] I heard you need RAM, so I'm going to give you storage.
[02:07:06 -> 02:07:09] Yeah, I have a lot of RAM on it.
[02:07:09 -> 02:07:12] The rent to my server was quite expensive.
[02:07:12 -> 02:07:15] What do you do with your server?
[02:07:15 -> 02:07:18] I host Minecraft.
[02:07:18 -> 02:07:21] You host what?
[02:07:21 -> 02:07:24] Okay, cool.
[02:07:24 -> 02:07:27] And then I storage pictures.
[02:07:27 -> 02:07:30] And developing.
[02:07:30 -> 02:07:33] So VMs, virtual machines.
[02:07:33 -> 02:07:36] You run virtual machines on servers.
[02:07:36 -> 02:07:39] Or Docker.
[02:07:39 -> 02:07:42] I started using Image recently.
[02:07:42 -> 02:07:45] Open sourced image hosting server.
[02:07:45 -> 02:07:48] And it's working pretty well.
[02:07:48 -> 02:07:51] With awareness.
[02:07:51 -> 02:07:54] With awareness.
[02:07:54 -> 02:07:57] We can push, I think.
[02:07:57 -> 02:08:00] I know why I buy this.
[02:08:00 -> 02:08:03] I saw that.
[02:08:03 -> 02:08:06] He's going to run away.
[02:08:06 -> 02:08:09] He's going to run away.
[02:08:09 -> 02:08:12] He's going to run away.
[02:08:12 -> 02:08:15] Oh, on three.
[02:08:16 -> 02:08:19] One on back.
[02:08:19 -> 02:08:22] There's one.
[02:08:32 -> 02:08:35] I got the healer.
[02:08:35 -> 02:08:38] I killed Reaper.
[02:08:45 -> 02:08:48] I killed Reaper.
[02:09:09 -> 02:09:12] Good to get.
[02:09:12 -> 02:09:15] I got the mercy.
[02:09:23 -> 02:09:26] I made a boo-boo.
[02:09:28 -> 02:09:31] Oh, my aim is great right now.
[02:09:36 -> 02:09:39] I hope my ult was not bad.
[02:09:40 -> 02:09:43] Sad.
[02:10:03 -> 02:10:06] There's a Hanzo up top or something.
[02:10:07 -> 02:10:10] Oh, nice.
[02:10:10 -> 02:10:13] Oh, nice.
[02:10:13 -> 02:10:16] I have no shield, I have no skills.
[02:10:26 -> 02:10:29] I didn't see the tank.
[02:10:29 -> 02:10:32] I'm on my way.
[02:10:37 -> 02:10:40] Oh, my God, I lost my ultimate.
[02:10:40 -> 02:10:43] That was so humbling.
[02:10:43 -> 02:10:46] What do you mean, you can lose your ult?
[02:10:46 -> 02:10:49] I didn't know that.
[02:10:49 -> 02:10:52] Yeah, when he hit me with the rock.
[02:11:01 -> 02:11:04] Be aware for Tracer behind.
[02:11:07 -> 02:11:10] He's up behind.
[02:11:22 -> 02:11:25] Oh, no.
[02:11:25 -> 02:11:28] Failed.
[02:11:28 -> 02:11:31] Didn't mean to press Q.
[02:11:31 -> 02:11:34] Pinky.
[02:11:34 -> 02:11:37] Where is he?
[02:11:37 -> 02:11:40] This is a pretty intense game.
[02:11:40 -> 02:11:43] Yeah.
[02:11:43 -> 02:11:46] She's not bad.
[02:11:46 -> 02:11:49] Yeah, she's so annoying as I was saying.
[02:11:49 -> 02:11:52] There's a wall.
[02:11:52 -> 02:11:55] I can't move.
[02:12:01 -> 02:12:04] Oh, nice.
[02:12:04 -> 02:12:07] Oh, nice.
[02:12:07 -> 02:12:10] Oh, nice.
[02:12:10 -> 02:12:13] Oh, nice.
[02:12:13 -> 02:12:16] Oh, nice.
[02:12:16 -> 02:12:19] Oh, nice.
[02:12:29 -> 02:12:32] Nice, nice, nice.
[02:12:32 -> 02:12:35] Don't let her red, please.
[02:12:35 -> 02:12:38] I cried, but she was in ult.
[02:12:46 -> 02:12:49] Oh, my God.
[02:12:57 -> 02:13:00] Nice kill.
[02:13:00 -> 02:13:03] Faster.
[02:13:10 -> 02:13:13] I ground.
[02:13:16 -> 02:13:19] Oh, nice.
[02:13:19 -> 02:13:22] Oh, nice.
[02:13:43 -> 02:13:46] Oh, my God.
[02:13:46 -> 02:13:49] She missed.
[02:13:49 -> 02:13:52] She missed.
[02:13:52 -> 02:13:55] Oh, my God.
[02:13:55 -> 02:13:58] I don't know where Tango is going.
[02:13:58 -> 02:14:01] Oh, that's you. Oh, sorry.
[02:14:01 -> 02:14:04] I don't know who's who.
[02:14:04 -> 02:14:07] I thought you played sup.
[02:14:16 -> 02:14:19] Oh, no.
[02:14:19 -> 02:14:22] Yeah, it was me.
[02:14:22 -> 02:14:25] Can anyone try to kill Mercy, please?
[02:14:25 -> 02:14:28] Can anyone try to kill Mercy, please?
[02:14:28 -> 02:14:31] I'm not.
[02:14:31 -> 02:14:34] I'm trying, but it's difficult for me.
[02:14:34 -> 02:14:37] Been trying.
[02:14:37 -> 02:14:40] I got my sentence ready.
[02:14:40 -> 02:14:43] So if you group up, we can run through them.
[02:14:43 -> 02:14:46] So if you group up, we can run through them.
[02:14:46 -> 02:14:49] No, I fell down.
[02:14:49 -> 02:14:52] I got the whole team on my base.
[02:14:52 -> 02:14:55] We group up.

[02:15:13 -> 02:15:16] Intense game.
[02:15:16 -> 02:15:19] Intense game.

[02:15:22 -> 02:15:25] One last fight.
[02:15:25 -> 02:15:28] Nice. Okay, I'm going to stay with you, tank.

[02:16:01 -> 02:16:04] You can push forward.

[02:37:30 -> 02:37:31] Damn.
[02:37:32 -> 02:37:33] Genji.
[02:37:39 -> 02:37:40] One point.

[02:37:44 -> 02:37:45] Why me?
[02:37:51 -> 02:37:53] This is like a three point.
[02:37:54 -> 02:37:56] You're not pushing in.
[02:38:00 -> 02:38:02] I'm just ignoring that Genji.
[02:38:04 -> 02:38:05] I got him.
[02:38:05 -> 02:38:06] I saw it.
[02:38:07 -> 02:38:09] I'm not even going to bother.
[02:38:18 -> 02:38:19] I got Shatter.
[02:38:19 -> 02:38:20] This is Julian.
[02:38:22 -> 02:38:24] I need to stay on the payload.
[02:38:30 -> 02:38:31] Ah.
[02:38:42 -> 02:38:44] Okay, she has...
[02:38:45 -> 02:38:46] No, no, no.
[02:38:46 -> 02:38:47] Yeah.
[02:38:48 -> 02:38:49] Just fall back.
[02:38:50 -> 02:38:51] She's on me.
[02:38:51 -> 02:38:54] There is no challenge I cannot face.
[02:38:58 -> 02:38:59] Hello.
[02:39:04 -> 02:39:06] There's a running path and lighting up.
[02:39:06 -> 02:39:08] I have to now lie on the team.
[02:39:14 -> 02:39:15] There's a bomb.
[02:39:16 -> 02:39:17] Back on the path.
[02:39:18 -> 02:39:19] Shit.
[02:39:21 -> 02:39:22] Fuck.
[02:39:34 -> 02:39:35] There's a soldier.
[02:39:37 -> 02:39:38] He's coming.
[02:39:42 -> 02:39:43] Soldier on me.
[02:39:45 -> 02:39:46] Oh, everyone on me.
[02:39:51 -> 02:40:01] I did the last stems as I thought I would do.
[02:40:01 -> 02:40:03] Now you're going to see what you didn't clip.
[02:40:17 -> 02:40:18] Oh my God.
[02:40:18 -> 02:40:20] Okay, that was really nice.
[02:40:20 -> 02:40:21] Good job.
[02:40:23 -> 02:40:24] Five kill.
[02:40:24 -> 02:40:25] Huge.
[02:40:26 -> 02:40:28] Huge play of the game.
[02:40:30 -> 02:40:32] You all consist of that as ace.
[02:40:44 -> 02:40:45] I chose her.
[02:40:45 -> 02:40:49] I initially chose Sigma, but then I switched to Reinhardt because I saw in the level
[02:40:49 -> 02:40:54] that there is Reinhardt scribbled on the bar.
[02:40:57 -> 02:41:01] So you wanted to stay true to the map lore?
[02:41:01 -> 02:41:02] I had to.
[02:41:02 -> 02:41:03] Yeah.
[02:41:04 -> 02:41:06] It must be done.
[02:41:06 -> 02:41:07] If it must be done.
[02:41:09 -> 02:41:10] It must.
[02:41:13 -> 02:41:14] Uh-oh.
[02:41:14 -> 02:41:15] IMDPS.
[02:41:17 -> 02:41:18] Pretty soft.
[02:41:20 -> 02:41:22] Oh, we have no DPS.
[02:41:25 -> 02:41:26] It's okay.
[02:41:26 -> 02:41:28] You're the best tank in the world.
[02:41:28 -> 02:41:29] You're going to carry us.
[02:41:29 -> 02:41:30] No worries.
[02:41:32 -> 02:41:34] We can just run around the map.
[02:41:34 -> 02:41:36] We don't have to do anything.
[02:41:37 -> 02:41:38] I mean, okay.
[02:41:39 -> 02:41:40] Okay.
[02:41:49 -> 02:41:51] Do you know the question?
[02:41:52 -> 02:41:54] Science holds the key to understanding.
[02:41:54 -> 02:41:55] No support.
[02:41:55 -> 02:41:56] DPS support, please.
[02:41:58 -> 02:41:59] How are you?
[02:42:01 -> 02:42:02] Nice.
[02:42:02 -> 02:42:03] DPS support.
[02:42:06 -> 02:42:10] Five, four, three, two, one.
[02:42:11 -> 02:42:12] Oh my God.
[02:42:13 -> 02:42:16] Some people are just very bold.
[02:42:16 -> 02:42:18] Supplying damage increased.
[02:42:18 -> 02:42:20] One of us goes through.
[02:42:23 -> 02:42:24] Cool.
[02:42:26 -> 02:42:28] Sustaining augmentation.
[02:42:30 -> 02:42:32] Oh, they have quite the neata.
[02:42:38 -> 02:42:39] We need to get them out.
[02:42:39 -> 02:42:41] The barrier has fallen.
[02:42:42 -> 02:42:43] I'm coming.
[02:42:55 -> 02:42:56] Not DPS support.
[02:43:00 -> 02:43:01] Aw, come on.
[02:43:02 -> 02:43:03] That was too far in.
[02:43:03 -> 02:43:05] Plus I had to kill people.
[02:43:05 -> 02:43:06] I killed them.
[02:43:07 -> 02:43:08] Come on.
[02:43:33 -> 02:43:34] I've been overwhelmed.
[02:43:35 -> 02:43:37] Aw, I'm so sorry, Marcy.
[02:43:37 -> 02:43:38] I fucked up.
[02:43:40 -> 02:43:41] I didn't have wall.
[02:43:41 -> 02:43:42] I wanted to help her.
[02:43:45 -> 02:43:46] Please, leave me alone.
[02:43:51 -> 02:43:52] I'm on fire.
[02:43:53 -> 02:43:55] Yeah, I have a fever.
[02:43:56 -> 02:43:57] A fever dream.
[02:44:00 -> 02:44:02] I have only one kill.
[02:44:05 -> 02:44:06] Ow.
[02:44:07 -> 02:44:08] I...
[02:44:35 -> 02:44:36] Did I not catch him?
[02:44:36 -> 02:44:38] What the fuck happened?
[02:44:51 -> 02:44:52] Where's Marcy?
[02:44:53 -> 02:44:54] I think she's dead.
[02:44:54 -> 02:44:55] She's dead.
[02:44:55 -> 02:44:56] Okay.
[02:44:57 -> 02:44:58] I escaped from Marcy.
[02:44:58 -> 02:44:59] I was looking for Marcy.
[02:44:59 -> 02:45:01] Worst ultimate in the world.
[02:45:03 -> 02:45:04] I really thought I got him.
[02:45:04 -> 02:45:05] No, not you, not you.
[02:45:05 -> 02:45:06] Mine, mine was shitty.
[02:45:08 -> 02:45:10] You got him, but he fell down.
[02:45:12 -> 02:45:13] He managed to get away.
[02:45:26 -> 02:45:27] It's over.
[02:45:41 -> 02:45:43] Did they buff Sigma?
[02:45:43 -> 02:45:47] Is the time for the boulder shorter?
[02:45:49 -> 02:45:51] I know that they have...
[02:45:53 -> 02:45:54] Increased damage, right?
[02:45:54 -> 02:45:55] Yeah.
[02:45:56 -> 02:45:57] Good bye, Marcy.
[02:45:59 -> 02:46:00] I'm sad.
[02:46:05 -> 02:46:06] No way.
[02:46:19 -> 02:46:20] Got him.
[02:46:24 -> 02:46:25] Oh.
[02:46:41 -> 02:46:42] Oh my god.
[02:46:42 -> 02:46:44] Almost got like two people.
[02:46:44 -> 02:46:45] So bad.
[02:46:54 -> 02:46:55] He's not...
[02:47:06 -> 02:47:07] He wasn't caught.
[02:47:09 -> 02:47:10] He wasn't caught.
[02:47:19 -> 02:47:20] What?
[02:47:21 -> 02:47:22] I'm so bad.
[02:47:25 -> 02:47:26] Return to me.
[02:47:28 -> 02:47:29] Let's go back on health.
[02:47:31 -> 02:47:32] So lost.
[02:47:35 -> 02:47:36] Okay.
[02:47:36 -> 02:47:37] No.
[02:47:53 -> 02:47:54] No, what?
[02:48:06 -> 02:48:07] Yeah.
[02:48:31 -> 02:48:32] Hmm.
[02:48:33 -> 02:48:36] Yeah, this Marcy is annoying.
[02:48:36 -> 02:48:37] She's killing me.
[02:49:02 -> 02:49:27] Oh, thank you, Marcy.
[02:49:32 -> 02:49:33] Oh.
[02:49:37 -> 02:49:38] Oh.
[02:49:38 -> 02:49:39] Oh my god.
[02:49:41 -> 02:49:42] Nice.
[02:49:42 -> 02:49:43] Good job.
[02:49:52 -> 02:49:53] Nice, good job.
[02:50:02 -> 02:50:03] Nice.
[02:50:24 -> 02:50:25] No.
[02:50:26 -> 02:50:29] Well, maybe I'll get rezzed.
[02:50:29 -> 02:50:32] Hopefully, because she's not rezzing you.
[02:50:48 -> 02:50:49] I have ultimate.
[02:50:53 -> 02:50:55] He might boulder me.
[02:50:55 -> 02:50:56] I don't know.
[02:50:59 -> 02:51:00] I don't know.
[02:51:18 -> 02:51:19] You guys keep pushing.
[02:51:19 -> 02:51:20] Yeah, yeah.
[02:51:20 -> 02:51:21] I'm on...
[02:51:21 -> 02:51:22] Yeah.
[02:51:22 -> 02:51:23] Yes.
[02:51:23 -> 02:51:24] Thank you.
[02:51:24 -> 02:51:26] I'm so sorry.
[02:51:29 -> 02:51:30] I'm getting mad.
[02:51:30 -> 02:51:32] I'm not getting mad.
[02:51:32 -> 02:51:33] It's just funny.
[02:51:51 -> 02:51:53] I'm trying to kill the Marcy.
[02:51:53 -> 02:51:54] Oh, okay.
[02:52:00 -> 02:52:02] She rezzed.
[02:52:09 -> 02:52:10] Oh my god.
[02:52:10 -> 02:52:12] They have all the ultimate.
[02:52:12 -> 02:52:14] Yeah, they actually have all of them.
[02:52:17 -> 02:52:18] Well, I'm sorry.
[02:52:18 -> 02:52:20] I should have switched earlier.
[02:52:22 -> 02:52:23] Yeah.
[02:52:30 -> 02:52:31] Close.
[02:52:35 -> 02:52:37] It was pretty tight up there though.
[02:52:37 -> 02:52:39] I told on me.
[02:52:41 -> 02:52:44] I locked into too late.
[02:52:57 -> 02:52:58] It's not about winning.
[02:52:58 -> 02:52:59] You're right.
[02:53:01 -> 02:53:02] It's true.
[02:53:02 -> 02:53:03] It's not about winning.
[02:53:03 -> 02:53:06] I played well when I switched to Soldier.
[02:53:06 -> 02:53:12] Probably I've been playing Soldier lately much more.
[02:53:14 -> 02:53:17] And it was working better.
[02:53:23 -> 02:53:25] It was a fun game anyway.
[02:53:25 -> 02:53:27] It was a fun game.
[02:53:27 -> 02:53:28] Yeah.
[02:53:28 -> 02:53:30] It was a fun game.
[02:53:30 -> 02:53:32] Let me see if I can...
[02:53:32 -> 02:53:34] Can you stop the queue?
[02:53:34 -> 02:53:36] I want to add a friend.
[02:53:44 -> 02:53:47] This is going to be my last match in Overwatch.
[02:53:47 -> 02:53:49] I'm going to switch to Ark after.
[02:53:51 -> 02:53:52] Okay.
[02:53:54 -> 02:53:56] I cannot invite him to the group.
[02:53:57 -> 02:53:59] Because we're searching.
[02:53:59 -> 02:54:01] You have to cancel.
[02:54:01 -> 02:54:02] Can you stop the queue?
[02:54:02 -> 02:54:03] Or is it me?
[02:54:03 -> 02:54:04] Oh, sorry.
[02:54:04 -> 02:54:06] I thought you were the leader.
[02:54:06 -> 02:54:07] I'm so stupid.
[02:54:09 -> 02:54:11] I still cannot invite.
[02:54:11 -> 02:54:13] What's happening?
[02:54:14 -> 02:54:16] He's not your friend anymore.
[02:54:16 -> 02:54:19] No, he's in a custom game.
[02:54:19 -> 02:54:20] That's why.
[02:54:21 -> 02:54:22] With a team?
[02:54:22 -> 02:54:23] Okay.
[02:54:23 -> 02:54:24] With a group?
[02:54:25 -> 02:54:26] Probably, I'm not sure.
[02:54:26 -> 02:54:27] Player is in another group.
[02:54:27 -> 02:54:28] Okay.
[02:54:28 -> 02:54:29] Yep.
[02:54:29 -> 02:54:30] The group.
[02:54:30 -> 02:54:32] He needs to leave custom, yeah.
[02:54:32 -> 02:54:33] Or just...
[02:54:33 -> 02:54:34] Wait.
[02:54:34 -> 02:54:38] Let's play your last game.
[02:54:50 -> 02:54:52] One last game.
[02:54:56 -> 02:55:02] I'm out of biscuits.
[02:55:02 -> 02:55:04] Out of biscuits?
[02:55:04 -> 02:55:05] Yeah.
[02:55:05 -> 02:55:07] Are these biscuits?
[02:55:07 -> 02:55:09] Which ones?
[02:55:09 -> 02:55:10] I think so, yeah.
[02:55:10 -> 02:55:14] I think they're considered biscuits, not cookies.
[02:55:16 -> 02:55:17] Yep.
[02:55:17 -> 02:55:20] They look like biscuits on the outside.
[02:55:20 -> 02:55:21] Yeah.
[02:55:21 -> 02:55:23] I think they're cookies, though.
[02:55:23 -> 02:55:27] The description says, biscuits with cocoa cream filling.
[02:55:27 -> 02:55:32] I think they know better what they make.
[02:55:36 -> 02:55:40] But everybody knows that Jaffa cake is not biscuits.
[02:55:42 -> 02:55:44] No, I call them biscuits.
[02:55:44 -> 02:55:45] You know what?
[02:55:45 -> 02:55:47] We play Doomfest on these, man.
[02:55:47 -> 02:55:48] Biscuits.
[02:56:18 -> 02:56:24] I read, I see Doomfest Defend on this map.
[02:56:24 -> 02:56:27] I promise you, I'm not wrong.
[02:56:27 -> 02:56:29] Maybe.
[02:56:29 -> 02:56:30] Maybe.
[02:56:30 -> 02:56:32] Maybe I'm wrong.
[02:56:32 -> 02:56:34] Maybe not.
[02:56:34 -> 02:56:36] Who knows?
[02:56:38 -> 02:56:41] What do you call a cute door?
[02:56:41 -> 02:56:42] Do you know?
[02:56:42 -> 02:56:43] No.
[02:56:43 -> 02:56:45] Adorable.
[02:56:46 -> 02:56:48] Nice.
[02:56:48 -> 02:56:50] It's good, it's good.
[02:56:50 -> 02:56:51] I like it.
[02:56:51 -> 02:56:52] Yeah.
[02:57:00 -> 02:57:02] Oh, Doom is on you.
[02:57:02 -> 02:57:03] I have a Doomfest as well.
[02:57:03 -> 02:57:06] And it's on me and on Hanzo.
[02:57:11 -> 02:57:13] Oh shit.
[02:57:14 -> 02:57:15] Doomfest.
[02:57:15 -> 02:57:17] Oh, that's ulti.
[02:57:17 -> 02:57:18] Doomfest.
[02:57:18 -> 02:57:20] But it's dead.
[02:57:28 -> 02:57:30] Yeah, they'll regret that.
[02:57:38 -> 02:57:40] I might went too far in.
[02:57:40 -> 02:57:42] No.
[02:57:43 -> 02:57:44] That's my...
[02:57:44 -> 02:57:46] It's not.
[02:57:46 -> 02:57:50] I thought everyone will be on the left side.
[02:57:53 -> 02:57:56] Okay, now we have a queen on us.
[02:57:56 -> 02:57:58] Yeah.
[02:57:59 -> 02:58:02] Okay, we need to fall back.
[02:58:12 -> 02:58:14] Oh shit.
[02:58:20 -> 02:58:22] Inside the tank.
[02:58:22 -> 02:58:23] What?
[02:58:23 -> 02:58:25] Damn, she's too far.
[02:58:26 -> 02:58:29] Nah, this guy is fucked.
[02:58:32 -> 02:58:35] I might went too far in, but I...
[02:58:42 -> 02:58:44] Oh shit.
[02:58:58 -> 02:59:01] No, not all of the ults, but okay.
[02:59:13 -> 02:59:15] No, no.
[02:59:15 -> 02:59:17] I'm gonna have to switch.
[02:59:18 -> 02:59:20] I'm gonna have to switch.
[02:59:20 -> 02:59:22] I'm kinda being dipped.
[02:59:24 -> 02:59:26] You're being dipped?
[02:59:27 -> 02:59:30] No, but they're just...
[02:59:32 -> 02:59:34] running over you.
[02:59:34 -> 02:59:35] Over me?
[02:59:35 -> 02:59:36] Yeah.
[02:59:36 -> 02:59:37] Or not.
[02:59:37 -> 02:59:38] Okay.
[02:59:38 -> 02:59:39] No, you're okay.
[02:59:39 -> 02:59:41] No, over me.
[02:59:43 -> 02:59:45] Haha.
[02:59:47 -> 02:59:48] Oh.
[02:59:48 -> 02:59:50] One eye is broken.
[02:59:51 -> 02:59:53] I have ults.
[03:00:12 -> 03:00:14] Thank you.
[03:00:33 -> 03:00:36] There's a Kiriko over here, I need help.
[03:00:36 -> 03:00:37] Yeah, I'm coming.
[03:00:37 -> 03:00:39] I think she teleported.
[03:00:43 -> 03:00:45] Beep, beep.
[03:00:46 -> 03:00:49] She's still around, she's still around.
[03:00:53 -> 03:00:55] Where did she go?
[03:00:55 -> 03:00:57] I don't know, she knows she can teleport.
[03:00:57 -> 03:01:00] No, but previously she was still there.
[03:01:00 -> 03:01:03] I don't know, I have no idea.
[03:01:13 -> 03:01:15] She's on the corner.
[03:01:15 -> 03:01:17] All right.
[03:01:27 -> 03:01:29] Stuck.
[03:01:42 -> 03:01:44] Life protects life.
[03:01:55 -> 03:01:57] There's a Junkrat behind us.
[03:02:03 -> 03:02:07] Oh my god, fuck you Mercy and your Rizzo.
[03:02:13 -> 03:02:16] What a spiral rebirth, hell, these ults.
[03:02:17 -> 03:02:19] Just have to stay on top.
[03:02:29 -> 03:02:32] I didn't read the situation really well.
[03:02:42 -> 03:02:44] Thank you.
[03:02:53 -> 03:02:56] There's no way I can help this Reaper.
[03:02:56 -> 03:02:59] Yeah, you come too far in all the time.
[03:03:12 -> 03:03:15] I got this one.
[03:03:42 -> 03:04:09] I need help with Queen, she's on me.
[03:04:09 -> 03:04:11] She wants my ass.
[03:04:11 -> 03:04:13] Thank you.
[03:04:23 -> 03:04:25] I mean she's getting razed.
[03:04:28 -> 03:04:30] Nice, good job.
[03:04:32 -> 03:04:34] Oh, you have no more razes?
[03:04:41 -> 03:04:43] Nice dive.
[03:05:00 -> 03:05:03] They're all on payload pushing.
[03:05:11 -> 03:05:13] Nice.
[03:05:35 -> 03:05:38] I cannot go there, I'm too afraid.
[03:05:41 -> 03:05:43] Okay, no more, bye.
[03:05:49 -> 03:05:51] Is that a very intense fight?
[03:05:53 -> 03:05:55] Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[03:06:11 -> 03:06:13] Goddamn, this Junkrat is always behind.
[03:06:33 -> 03:06:35] Another close game.
[03:06:41 -> 03:06:44] I'm sorry, I was trying to flank but...
[03:06:54 -> 03:06:56] Yeah, another close game.
[03:06:59 -> 03:07:01] You did well, Sasha.
[03:07:01 -> 03:07:03] I think you did well.
[03:07:03 -> 03:07:05] See?
[03:07:09 -> 03:07:11] This was that ult, I think.
[03:07:23 -> 03:07:26] Well, thank you for the games, Unicorn.
[03:07:26 -> 03:07:28] Thank you.
[03:07:28 -> 03:07:31] Have fun in Arc Raiders and don't forget...
[03:07:31 -> 03:07:33] Hey, don't shoot!
[03:07:33 -> 03:07:35] Wanna team up?
[03:07:39 -> 03:07:41] Okay, I'll see you soon, bye bye.
[03:07:41 -> 03:07:43] See you, bye ya!
[03:08:02 -> 03:08:04] Okay.
[03:08:18 -> 03:08:22] I need to update all my streams now.
[03:08:31 -> 03:08:33] Okay.
[03:08:41 -> 03:08:45] We had some intense matches, they were fun.
[03:08:52 -> 03:08:57] Oh, I see bosses, you're playing, you're printing Arc Raider, watching us, that's fun.
[03:09:01 -> 03:09:03] Okay.
[03:09:14 -> 03:09:16] I need to fight the big arcs.
[03:09:16 -> 03:09:20] I need to upgrade my workbenches.
[03:09:20 -> 03:09:23] So I'm gonna have to fight the big arcs now.
[03:09:31 -> 03:09:34] I need to upgrade my workbenches.
[03:09:34 -> 03:09:37] Down, down, down...
[03:10:04 -> 03:10:08] Down, down, down...
[03:10:35 -> 03:10:40] You're trying to do the mission about Serge Baron Husk, the old giant arc?
[03:10:40 -> 03:10:42] Yeah, okay.
[03:10:43 -> 03:10:47] Bosses, if you want, we could...
[03:10:47 -> 03:10:54] Yeah, I'm gonna have to fight bastions, rocketeers, bombardiers, like everything.
[03:10:54 -> 03:10:58] And I see bosses, you're trying to do the mission about Serge the Baron Husk.
[03:10:58 -> 03:11:00] Yeah, I know that one.
[03:11:00 -> 03:11:04] It's actually not bad loot when you kill him.
[03:11:04 -> 03:11:08] Or after you loot him, because you don't really kill him.
[03:11:08 -> 03:11:10] Maximum weight I can carry.
[03:11:10 -> 03:11:13] I think I'll upgrade this, or...
[03:11:15 -> 03:11:19] Movement speed while crouching.
[03:11:19 -> 03:11:22] Broad shoulders first.
[03:11:23 -> 03:11:26] I just have to make sure that...
[03:11:26 -> 03:11:29] I just feel like my desktop...
[03:11:29 -> 03:11:33] There's something wrong with my desktop.
[03:11:42 -> 03:11:44] Should be fine.
[03:11:44 -> 03:11:47] Practice range... No, it's fine now.
[03:11:47 -> 03:11:50] Okay, so what do I have to do?
[03:11:53 -> 03:11:56] Let's check my workshops.
[03:11:57 -> 03:12:00] So, gunsmith.
[03:12:00 -> 03:12:02] Sentinel firing corps. These are...
[03:12:02 -> 03:12:04] Oh, I have rusted gears, I have not rusted...
[03:12:04 -> 03:12:06] That's fine.
[03:12:06 -> 03:12:08] I need one more sentinel...
[03:12:08 -> 03:12:11] Oh, actually, four more sentinel firing corps.
[03:12:11 -> 03:12:15] And I can find these in the sentinels.
[03:12:15 -> 03:12:19] On dam, on buried city.
[03:12:19 -> 03:12:23] I know how to find them on dam or on buried city.
[03:12:24 -> 03:12:25] Gear bench.
[03:12:25 -> 03:12:28] Bastion cells. I have none.
[03:12:30 -> 03:12:32] Explosive station.
[03:12:32 -> 03:12:36] One more racketeer driver and one more laboratory regent.
[03:12:38 -> 03:12:41] Racketeers. Okay, I'll figure it out.
[03:12:41 -> 03:12:44] I kind of need to kill everything.
[03:12:44 -> 03:12:46] Bombardier. Okay, full.
[03:12:46 -> 03:12:50] Surveyor. These are pretty annoying to find.
[03:12:53 -> 03:12:56] Dam battlegrounds, buried city, and spaceport.
[03:12:56 -> 03:13:01] Yeah, I don't know where to find the sentinels on spaceport.
[03:13:03 -> 03:13:07] You can find those inside bunkers or buried city.
[03:13:08 -> 03:13:12] You can find those inside bunkers or buried city.
[03:13:13 -> 03:13:15] Okay.
[03:13:15 -> 03:13:17] And utility, leaper potion.
[03:13:17 -> 03:13:21] So like leapers are probably easiest to fight.
[03:13:23 -> 03:13:26] That doesn't mean it's easy to fight them.
[03:13:28 -> 03:13:31] Departure building, trench towers.
[03:13:31 -> 03:13:33] Trench towers.
[03:13:38 -> 03:13:41] On top of the trench towers?
[03:13:42 -> 03:13:44] I think you're right.
[03:13:48 -> 03:13:51] In space. Yes, you can find them in space.
[03:13:51 -> 03:13:55] In like, kind of everything is in space.
[03:13:58 -> 03:14:00] I know, I know. Space the map.
[03:14:02 -> 03:14:06] I'm happy to accept people if you want to join.
[03:14:06 -> 03:14:08] You don't have to though.
[03:14:08 -> 03:14:14] Because I know it's more difficult with more people during night raids.
[03:14:17 -> 03:14:25] Since I'm not trying to do PvP, I will probably take an anvil with me.
[03:14:31 -> 03:14:46] And I just hope like I won't be matched with aggro people now.
[03:14:46 -> 03:14:50] So who am I trying to kill first?
[03:14:50 -> 03:14:52] Maybe a leaper?
[03:14:52 -> 03:14:54] If I'm doing the leaper.
[03:14:54 -> 03:14:58] Oh, so it's going to be a leaper or any of the big ones.
[03:14:59 -> 03:15:01] I think I need grenades.
[03:15:01 -> 03:15:03] Grenades are kind of easier.
[03:15:13 -> 03:15:15] Magnets. Damn.
[03:15:15 -> 03:15:19] I don't want to waste magnets.
[03:15:19 -> 03:15:22] But I kind of need to do this.
[03:15:22 -> 03:15:25] Like maybe like take like six grenades.
[03:15:26 -> 03:15:29] And hope for the best, right?
[03:15:32 -> 03:15:34] And a bit more ammo.
[03:15:47 -> 03:15:49] I just want to check that.
[03:15:50 -> 03:15:56] My framerate is fine, so I'll go to practice first.
[03:15:56 -> 03:16:20] It's just like my mouse feels a bit slow.
[03:16:20 -> 03:16:24] That's that's what the FPS feels fine.
[03:16:24 -> 03:16:25] It's just my mouse.
[03:16:25 -> 03:16:27] I don't know why.
[03:16:31 -> 03:16:36] For solo I'm playing with toroketel4 and hairpin4.
[03:16:36 -> 03:16:40] Okay, so hairpin is not a common choice.
[03:16:40 -> 03:16:41] Anvil is so good.
[03:16:41 -> 03:16:44] I guess every time I try to use it in solo, someone try to kill me.
[03:16:44 -> 03:16:47] Yeah, anvil is I find it very good against arcs.
[03:16:47 -> 03:16:53] I don't like it a lot versus people, but I don't know how you use the hairpin.
[03:16:53 -> 03:16:58] I have issues finding good uses for the hairpin.
[03:17:06 -> 03:17:08] FPS is fine.
[03:17:08 -> 03:17:10] We're returning to Esperanza.
[03:17:10 -> 03:17:11] Okay.
[03:17:24 -> 03:17:27] Damn electromagnetic storm.
[03:17:30 -> 03:17:33] I will try to be friendly.
[03:17:34 -> 03:17:36] I will try to be friendly.
[03:17:37 -> 03:17:39] I promise.
[03:17:41 -> 03:17:46] I promise I will be friendly.
[03:17:46 -> 03:17:48] I promise I will try to be friendly.
[03:17:55 -> 03:17:57] I promise I'll try.
[03:18:03 -> 03:18:06] I don't know if I'm lying.
[03:18:06 -> 03:18:09] In solos, I like to be friendly.
[03:18:11 -> 03:18:14] Faster in silence.
[03:18:17 -> 03:18:19] Okay.
[03:18:19 -> 03:18:22] Testing Gainax research admin.
[03:18:22 -> 03:18:24] So there's one...
[03:18:29 -> 03:18:32] There's usually a leaper around here, right?
[03:18:34 -> 03:18:38] I used to like the hairpin when I was doing solos.
[03:18:38 -> 03:18:44] It's just to me it felt like I was not doing noise
[03:18:44 -> 03:18:49] and it was more difficult for other players to find me.
[03:18:52 -> 03:18:56] But I still don't find it good against arc.
[03:19:08 -> 03:19:10] Do I want to be noisy?
[03:19:10 -> 03:19:14] Oh my God, this game is so loud during the electromagnetic storm.
[03:19:14 -> 03:19:16] I need that.
[03:19:25 -> 03:19:27] Uh-oh.
[03:19:29 -> 03:19:31] Yep.
[03:19:32 -> 03:19:34] Yep.
[03:19:38 -> 03:19:40] Stop moving.
[03:19:42 -> 03:19:44] Thank you.
[03:19:45 -> 03:19:47] Another one.
[03:20:01 -> 03:20:03] Okay.
[03:20:09 -> 03:20:15] Yeah, I think it feels like people go in solos
[03:20:15 -> 03:20:17] to do their quests
[03:20:17 -> 03:20:24] and in multiplayer like duos or trios to fight other people.
[03:20:24 -> 03:20:28] Oh, that's a sentinel.
[03:20:32 -> 03:20:36] There is someone over there, so...
[03:20:37 -> 03:20:42] Seems like they're not trying to kill the sentinel.
[03:20:44 -> 03:20:47] I could kill it.
[03:20:51 -> 03:20:58] And I would be happy to loot the sentinel and just get out at the moment.
[03:21:01 -> 03:21:07] Is it two shots or more?
[03:21:07 -> 03:21:15] One, two, three, four, five, six.
[03:21:15 -> 03:21:17] Oh, shit.
[03:21:17 -> 03:21:19] I have to reload.
[03:21:31 -> 03:21:33] Okay.
[03:21:37 -> 03:21:41] It's more than two shots.
[03:21:41 -> 03:21:43] Hello.
[03:21:43 -> 03:21:47] Can I get some help?
[03:21:47 -> 03:21:49] Yeah, you're going to be shot.
[03:21:49 -> 03:21:51] You're going to be shot.
[03:21:51 -> 03:21:53] Oh, that's good.
[03:21:53 -> 03:21:55] I can move into a different position.
[03:21:55 -> 03:21:57] Are you friendly?
[03:21:57 -> 03:22:00] Yeah, but I don't have a defib.
[03:22:04 -> 03:22:07] I don't even have bandages.
[03:22:13 -> 03:22:16] How many do you have?
[03:22:18 -> 03:22:20] A third.
[03:22:28 -> 03:22:31] Someone's shooting me.
[03:22:37 -> 03:22:41] I have like 10% now.
[03:22:41 -> 03:22:44] Well, oh, shit.
[03:22:44 -> 03:22:45] Enjoy.
[03:22:45 -> 03:22:47] Goodbye.
[03:22:54 -> 03:22:55] Ouch.
[03:22:55 -> 03:23:00] So it's a bit more than six shots, it seems like.
[03:23:00 -> 03:23:03] How much damage did I do to it?
[03:23:03 -> 03:23:08] I did 280 damage.
[03:23:10 -> 03:23:14] So it's got more than that story.
[03:23:14 -> 03:23:16] Let's go again.
[03:23:16 -> 03:23:21] You see, I saved my grenades.
[03:23:21 -> 03:23:27] I felt like those were the most valuable.
[03:23:27 -> 03:23:31] So I should be more careful.
[03:23:31 -> 03:23:36] Let's do best gear bench.
[03:23:36 -> 03:23:38] Make a looting MK1.
[03:23:38 -> 03:23:42] I already have a shield.
[03:23:42 -> 03:23:44] 300 HP.
[03:23:44 -> 03:23:45] So I was...
[03:23:45 -> 03:23:47] I see, I see.
[03:23:47 -> 03:23:52] And I don't know if it has a weak spot.
[03:23:52 -> 03:23:56] I took all of my ammo.
[03:24:07 -> 03:24:09] Bandages.
[03:24:09 -> 03:24:11] Shields.
[03:24:12 -> 03:24:14] Grenades.
[03:24:18 -> 03:24:21] Bit expensive to repair.
[03:24:21 -> 03:24:26] But I do have the additional 10% because I did the expedition.
[03:24:26 -> 03:24:30] So what should I do?
[03:24:34 -> 03:24:36] I'm not going to do it.
[03:24:36 -> 03:24:39] No, I shouldn't use this gun so much.
[03:24:39 -> 03:24:41] So it shouldn't break.
[03:24:41 -> 03:24:45] I feel like it shouldn't break.
[03:24:46 -> 03:24:48] Yes, it is damaged.
[03:24:48 -> 03:24:51] Aim for the yellow canister on the swivel.
[03:24:51 -> 03:24:55] Arm to deal increased damage.
[03:25:03 -> 03:25:06] Something to help me get up on my own.
[03:25:06 -> 03:25:07] So do you remember...
[03:25:07 -> 03:25:09] You said you played Apex previously.
[03:25:09 -> 03:25:12] Do you remember that shield in Apex?
[03:25:12 -> 03:25:15] Which was kind of breaking the game, especially at the last fight.
[03:25:15 -> 03:25:21] Because you could get up while the circle was destroying you.
[03:25:21 -> 03:25:25] And it felt game breaking and I think they removed it.
[03:25:25 -> 03:25:29] I'm not sure there should be something trying to get on my own.
[03:25:29 -> 03:25:31] I like this game.
[03:25:31 -> 03:25:35] Makes me feel really vulnerable.
[03:25:35 -> 03:25:44] But I do feel like, oh, I cannot do this.
[03:25:44 -> 03:25:46] Maybe there should be something to help me.
[03:25:46 -> 03:25:50] I understand that reasoning.
[03:25:54 -> 03:25:56] Everybody's going to use that.
[03:25:56 -> 03:26:02] We already have the MK3 that doesn't allow you to get up.
[03:26:02 -> 03:26:06] But it heals you up quite a lot.
[03:26:06 -> 03:26:11] And it's pretty powerful.
[03:26:14 -> 03:26:18] So I don't know, I don't know for sure.
[03:26:18 -> 03:26:22] This cannot be looted.
[03:26:26 -> 03:26:30] I feel like if they add something like that, it will be game breaking.
[03:26:30 -> 03:26:32] Everybody would need that item.
[03:26:32 -> 03:26:36] So how do you make that item balanced?
[03:26:41 -> 03:26:46] Even if you're doing 3v3 PvP, you're fighting.
[03:26:46 -> 03:26:49] You get down, you're in a safe position.
[03:26:49 -> 03:26:52] And then your teammates doesn't have to be...
[03:26:52 -> 03:26:56] We already have the defib, which is pretty powerful.
[03:26:56 -> 03:26:59] So your teammates can fight the other team while you get up on your own.
[03:26:59 -> 03:27:04] And they spent a lot of resources to down you for almost nothing.
[03:27:04 -> 03:27:07] So how do you balance that?
[03:27:12 -> 03:27:16] People over there.
[03:27:18 -> 03:27:22] They didn't shoot me.
[03:27:26 -> 03:27:28] It's a tough one.
[03:27:28 -> 03:27:32] It's a difficult thing.
[03:27:43 -> 03:27:47] Oh damn, someone died.
[03:27:47 -> 03:27:51] People are not super friendly.
[03:27:58 -> 03:28:01] Oh my arms are fucked up again.
[03:28:01 -> 03:28:03] Look at me running.
[03:28:03 -> 03:28:06] Look at me sliding.
[03:28:11 -> 03:28:15] I look like I have 5 years old and I don't know how to run.
[03:28:17 -> 03:28:23] So there's people who are not friendly in here and I'm going right straight at them.
[03:28:29 -> 03:28:33] Okay, my arms are fixed now.
[03:28:33 -> 03:28:37] Flip that, please, please, please.
[03:28:37 -> 03:28:40] So we have a leaper over here.
[03:28:40 -> 03:28:44] Oh shit, hello, hello, I'm friendly, I'm friendly.
[03:28:45 -> 03:28:49] Thank you for not shooting me.
[03:28:49 -> 03:28:52] Oh, friendly people.
[03:28:52 -> 03:28:54] Someone did die over there.
[03:28:54 -> 03:28:58] Oh no, someone else is fighting the leaper now.
[03:29:00 -> 03:29:08] So now my question is, do I wait for them to kill the leaper and then kill the person and take the leaper parts?
[03:29:10 -> 03:29:14] I am friendly, but you know, not.
[03:29:14 -> 03:29:22] I am friendly, but you know, not friendly if I did that right.
[03:29:24 -> 03:29:28] I should be friendly.
[03:29:30 -> 03:29:36] I like the couriers, sometimes couriers give you good loot.
[03:29:44 -> 03:29:54] Did they reduce the amount of, oh, I was about to ask, did they reduce the amount of lightnings?
[03:29:54 -> 03:29:58] And I don't think they did, actually.
[03:30:04 -> 03:30:06] I'm friendly, dude.
[03:30:06 -> 03:30:08] Oh, shotty.
[03:30:08 -> 03:30:14] So, okay, now.
[03:30:18 -> 03:30:21] I did two shotguns, right?
[03:30:21 -> 03:30:26] Okay, I did get the core, which is useful, but I lost a lot.
[03:30:26 -> 03:30:28] So what do I do now?
[03:30:28 -> 03:30:30] With the shotgun, he isn't friendly.
[03:30:30 -> 03:30:32] Yeah.
[03:30:32 -> 03:30:40] So now how can I be friendly?
[03:30:40 -> 03:30:44] Now, this next game, should I be friendly?
[03:30:56 -> 03:30:58] I agree, I agree.
[03:30:58 -> 03:31:06] I didn't trust him, I just didn't see him and he just double tapped me when I was, make some friends.
[03:31:09 -> 03:31:11] Team up with someone, make some friends.
[03:31:11 -> 03:31:17] Like, okay, go solo, but team up with someone, right?
[03:31:29 -> 03:31:37] Now, the good thing is that when he took my anvil four, it's destroyed.
[03:31:37 -> 03:31:45] Because you lose 30% when, like, all items lose 30% when you die.
[03:31:45 -> 03:31:49] So at least he cannot use it.
[03:31:51 -> 03:31:55] That's my only win in that scenario.
[03:31:59 -> 03:32:03] And the core.
[03:32:03 -> 03:32:30] I feel much better when I can shoot people.
[03:32:33 -> 03:32:39] Because then I don't have to wonder will they shoot me in the back or not.
[03:32:39 -> 03:32:42] And then I take their stuff.
[03:32:44 -> 03:32:46] I like that.
[03:32:57 -> 03:33:00] So let's make some friends.
[03:33:00 -> 03:33:03] Hey, do you want to be my friend?
[03:33:06 -> 03:33:08] No.
[03:33:20 -> 03:33:23] Hey, hey, you want to be friends?
[03:33:23 -> 03:33:26] Hello, do you want to be friends?
[03:33:27 -> 03:33:30] No.
[03:33:40 -> 03:33:43] Trying to find friends.
[03:33:43 -> 03:33:48] So the arcs don't really want to be friendly.
[03:33:56 -> 03:34:06] Will I find other friendlies around here?
[03:34:06 -> 03:34:10] Oh, someone's fighting the leaper.
[03:34:10 -> 03:34:15] Oh, I really want to fight some people.
[03:34:26 -> 03:34:31] I think I'm going to do a good job.
[03:34:31 -> 03:34:33] Yeah.
[03:34:33 -> 03:34:36] I don't know what is going to happen.
[03:34:36 -> 03:34:41] I think I'm going to kill someone.
[03:34:41 -> 03:34:51] right before their boards.
[03:34:51 -> 03:35:05] Okay, I'll try to be friendly.
[03:35:05 -> 03:35:25] If I die again, I'm gonna have to reconsider.
[03:35:25 -> 03:35:46] Let's get out since, like, I don't have much space anyway.
[03:35:46 -> 03:35:48] They killed the sentinel.
[03:35:48 -> 03:35:50] Did I protect the sentinel?
[03:35:50 -> 03:35:58] I mean, who are the good guys in this scenario?
[03:35:58 -> 03:36:02] Maybe I'm a friend of the sentinel.
[03:36:02 -> 03:36:18] Hello, I hope you're friendly.
[03:36:18 -> 03:36:21] Okay.
[03:36:21 -> 03:36:22] See I was friendly.
[03:36:22 -> 03:36:30] I didn't, I didn't shoot on sight.
[03:36:30 -> 03:36:35] Honestly it's way more stressful to be friendly.
[03:36:35 -> 03:36:43] Okay.
[03:36:43 -> 03:36:51] There's a bombardier there and this is the field depot.
[03:36:51 -> 03:36:53] Do I need to?
[03:36:53 -> 03:37:03] I will want to, I will have to do these quests with a field depot.
[03:37:04 -> 03:37:13] I found a prickly pear.
[03:37:13 -> 03:37:18] I don't know why they call them prickly pears because they're clearly like cactus fruit
[03:37:18 -> 03:37:25] or cacti.
[03:37:25 -> 03:37:26] I'm sorry.
[03:37:26 -> 03:37:44] I'm friendly, I'm friendly.
[03:37:44 -> 03:37:49] Do I have time to drop this?
[03:37:49 -> 03:38:01] I don't think I do.
[03:38:01 -> 03:38:06] So I have two minutes starting now.
[03:38:06 -> 03:38:11] I think I have time to do the quest.
[03:38:11 -> 03:38:16] Mushrooms.
[03:38:16 -> 03:38:19] So there's one room on Stella Montes.
[03:38:19 -> 03:38:36] If you, if you can stomach that map, which has lots of mushrooms, I'm going to want
[03:38:36 -> 03:38:49] to use this.
[03:38:49 -> 03:38:53] Do I need to do something with the quest?
[03:38:53 -> 03:38:54] Nope.
[03:38:54 -> 03:38:55] One around.
[03:38:55 -> 03:39:00] Oh, it's already closed.
[03:39:00 -> 03:39:08] Let's hope I don't die now.
[03:39:08 -> 03:39:12] I can show you, I can show you on Stella Montes where you can find it.
[03:39:12 -> 03:39:16] It's not that difficult and you find lots and lots of fruit there.
[03:39:16 -> 03:39:22] I will do it actually after this, after this map.
[03:39:22 -> 03:39:25] I almost know exactly where it is.
